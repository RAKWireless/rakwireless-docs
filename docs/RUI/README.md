# Getting Started

## Overview

RAKwireless is a leading provider of low-power, wide-area Internet of Things (IoT) solutions in the industry. It provides from basic modules to complex but modular solutions for the IoT, smart city, and smart agriculture sectors.

In the field of LoRa communication, RAKwireless has launched RAK811, RAK4200, RAK4270, RAK4600, and other communication modules with LoRaWAN and Lora P2P functions.

RAK's LoRaWAN node modules support not only out-of-the-box integration through the use of traditional AT commands, but also allows users to customize the firmware and access to the functionalities of the internal MCU. Users can adapt and extend the logic in the firmware to meet the requirements of their own solution.

This document is aimed at developers who are familiar with the hardware of the RAK LoRaWAN module but want to extend its functionalities through customized versions of the firmware. In the following sections, the concept of the RAKwireless Unified Interface (RUI) API is introduced and explanations about how to extend the existing functionalities of the modules are provided. 

Currently, the supported LoRaWAN modules are:
*	RAK811 LoRaWAN module
*	RAK4200 LoRaWAN module
*	RAK4270 LoRaWAN module
*	RAK4600 LoRaWAN module
*	Other complex modules that have the above modules inside, such as, RAK5205, RAK7204, etc.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The content of this document applies to modules with firmware version **3.x.x.14** and **above**. If it is lower than this version, please refer to the link below.

## RUI Customized Development

**RAKWireless Unified Interface (RUI)** is the standard interface defined to simplify the firmware development for the ecosystem of the hardware of RAK. RUI defines an API that abstracts the complexity of the hardware layer. Through the RUI API, customers can control all the functionalities of the module without the need to deal with the complexity of low-level hardware protocols such as SPI, I2C, etc.

### RUI Framework

As shown in Figure 1, a firmware based on the RUI comprises two parts: the RUI SDK and the application.

The SDK is the core of RUI. It was developed to support multiple types of the RAK's LoRaWAN modules. The complexity of the hardware is hidden and abstracted in this layer in order to expose a unified RUI API interface to simplify the development of the application layer. The application layer should contain the implementation of the business logic of the customized solution. 

For the purpose and usage of RUI API, please refer to the [RUI AP Reference](/RUI/rui-api-reference/) Manual.

/>

The application is open-sourced. Users can take the existing application code provided by RAK as a reference and extend it according to their business requirements. 

The RUI SDK layer is not open-sourced. These libraries are available through the RUI Online Compiler. Once users have finalized their application code, they can make use of the RUI Online Compiler to generate the final firmware. The output binary will contain the RUI SDK and the application code ready to be loaded into the target module. 

### API Usage

The RUI SDK is not only for the external users, inside RAK, the development teams also make use of RUI SDK to implement and maintain efficiently the official version of firmware for all the LoRaWAN modules and products. RAK has published the application code of the official firmware at Github. Users can take them as a reference, not only to understand how to use the API but also to extend it for the customers‚Äô final solutions. Beside the official application code, RAK also makes available sample codes of typical solutions based on the RAK LoRaWAN modules.

You can find the RAK‚Äôs repository in Github in this URL: [https://github.com/RAKWireless/Products_practice_based_on_RUI_v2.0](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Products_practice_based_on_RUI_v2.0)

As shown in Figure 2, the code repository is classified according to the model of the core module. Specific sample codes can be found inside of the directory of the corresponding core module.

Taking the RAK811 module as an example. After entering into the "base on RAK811" directory, as shown in Figure 3, examples of application code based on the RAK811 module can be found. Some show how to control peripherals and sensors, others are the actual official firmware of products based on the RAK811 module. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/rui/rui-customized-development/github-repo-sample-code.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK‚Äôs Github, sample code"
/>

In Figure 3, the "RAK5205" directory contains the application source code corresponding to the official firmware of RAK5205. The RAK5205 is based on the RAK811 module, adding the environmental monitoring sensor (BME680), a three-axis acceleration sensor (lis3dh), and GPS module (Ublox Max 7q). The code example in this directory shows how to connect other sensors through I2C and GPS module through UART based on RAK811 module and complete the development of customized firmware through the RUI API.

The ‚ÄúRAK7204 " directory contains the application source code corresponding to the official firmware of RAK7204, an indoor environmental IoT product which including the sensor driver, AT command implementation, application logic processing, etc. In this implementation, quite a lot of RUI APIs are used. RAK7204 is based on the RAK811 module, and an environmental monitoring sensor (BME680) is added. Therefore, you can learn how to add an I2C sensor based on the RAK811 module through the product practice code, and quickly complete the development of customized firmware through the call of RUI API. For example, "app_7204.c ", see Figure 4, is the implementation of application logic processing. If you want to customize the application logic, you can focus on the code inside to understand the actual usage of RUI API.

The ‚ÄúRAK811" is the application code corresponding to the official firmware of the RAK811 module. 

### Application Development

These sample codes on RAK‚Äôs Github repository are actually complete applications. For example, the RAK7204 example code described earlier is shown in Figure 4. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/rui/rui-customized-development/rak7204-sample-code.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK‚Äôs Github, RAK7204 sample code"
/>

For instance, Once the node received a LoRaWAN downlink data, it only prints the data out through the serial port without actually doing any action. Figure 5 shows a snippet of this callback from the "**app_7204.c**" file:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/rui/rui-customized-development/rak7204-source-code.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAK‚Äôs Github, app_7204.c source code"
/>

Within this callback, customers can add their logic here and control a peripheral of RAK811 according to the content of the downlink data. 

### Compile Application

After the customized an application code, you can use the RUI Online Compiler to generate the binaries. During the compilation (actually compilation and linking), the Online Compiler will automatically link the application with the libraries of RUI SDK together to output the final customized firmware. For specific usage, please refer to section 3, the online compilation platform.

### Download Firmware

Once the binary file is generated from the previous step, it has to be burned into the flash memory of the target modules. RAK has provided a ‚Äú**Firmware Update Tool**‚Äù, which simplifies this process. The tool can be download from this URL:

* [Device Firmware Upgrade Tool for Windows](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/Tools/RAK_Device_Firmware_Upgrade_Tool_v1.4.zip)
* [Device Firmware Upgrade Tool for MacOS](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/Tools/RAK_Device_Firmware_Upgrade_Tool_v1.4_MacOS.zip)
* [Device Firmware Upgrade Tool for Ubuntu](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/Tools/RAK_Device_Firmware_Upgrade_Tool_v1.4_Ubuntu.zip)

As shown in Figure 6, the firmware update process is as simple as choosing the right serial port, select the binary file, and execute the update to the target module. This process should take less than one minute.
