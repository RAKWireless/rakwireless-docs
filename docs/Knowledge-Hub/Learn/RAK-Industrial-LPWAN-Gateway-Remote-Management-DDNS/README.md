# RAK Industrial LPWAN Gateway Remote Management - DDNS

* [Register a DDNS Service](#register-a-ddns-service)
* [Gateway DDNS Service Set-up](#gateway-ddns-service-set-up)

## Overview

This tutorial describes on how to use the fast and simple Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) Service to access the RAK Industrial Gateways. 

Several points must be taken into considerations:

* For accessing the Gateway behind a router, you have to consult with your router documentation in order to implement Port Forwarding or Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), so you can remotely access your Gateway.

* For accessing the Gateway, when connected through an LTE network, please contact your cellular service provider in order to implement Port Forwarding.

# Register a DDNS Service

In using Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS), you can assign a Domain name that you link to your Gateway‚Äôs Real IP Address. This allows you to access your Gateway with a Domain name that is static and will not change even if a new IP address is assigned to the Gateway, making sure you don‚Äôt have to keep a lengthy list of address that needs to be constantly updated. The DDNS service takes care of this for you.

## Choosing your DDNS Provider

A list of providers supported by the RAK Industrial Gateway series can be found below.

::: tip üìù NOTE
For this sample demonstration, the dyndnss.net DDNS service provider shall be used.

(4) - needs additional package ddns-scripts_nsupdate and bind-client to be installed.<br>
(5) - SSL support required.<br>
(6) - support IPv6

4. In the Dynamic DNS (Beta) configuration page, **Enable** the service. Next, fill in the necessary credentials:

* **Lookup Hostname**: dyndnss.net
* **DDNS Service provider**: dyndnss.net
* **Hostname/Domain**: The domain created in the [Create a DynDNS URL](#create-a-dyndns-url) (see Figure 4)
* **Username**: DynDNSS Username used.

5. Open the Advanced Settings tab. Next, fill in the necessary credentials and click "**Save & Apply**".

* **IP Address source**: Network (default)
* **Network**: WAN (default) 

::: tip üìù NOTE
This mean that the DDNS Service of the Gateway will check and report to dyndnss.net the WAN IP of the Gateway. If you want to access your Gateway trough different backhaul you can choose it here.
