# The Importance of High Power WiFi Module and Power Line Communications

A WiFi module is a self-contained SOC with integrated TCP/IP protocol stack that can give any microcontroller the access to a WiFi network. The WiFi modules have many functions including hosting applications, offloading all WiFi networking functions from another application processor etc.

**A high Power Wi-Fi module platform is**:
* Cost effective
* High power
* Flexible
* Used for embedded devices.
* Used in applications such as wireless sensors and thermostats.

A high power WiFi module is a combination of ARM7 based processors, an RF transceiver, 802.11 MAC, security and PHY functions, which works with IEEE regulatory domains.

The high power WiFi module uses a RTC (Real Time Clock) that runs from a battery and uses an external antenna as an interface. It also has power supply monitoring capability and low power mode operations in functions as in Sleep, Deep Sleep and Standby.

**Power Line Communication WiFi Module**

* A [Power Line Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-line_communication) (PLC) is a communication technology that is useful in sending data over existing power cables. The power cables of an electronic device can use the power cables to power up the device and control/ retrieve data simultaneously. The data retrieval happens in a half-duplex manner.

* This module effectively eliminates the need for an extra cable for data transfer or a separate power supply for the device. There are two types of PLCs:The Narrowband PLC – This works at lower frequencies (3-500 KHz), lower data rates and has a longer range up to several kilometers and is extendable using repeaters. Smart Grid and smart energy generation in micro inverters for solar panels uses this widely.The Broadband PLC – This works at higher frequencies, high data rates, and comes in use in short-range applications. It comes in useful in Internet distribution and home networking and is the choice of many companies in the Home Area Networking (HAN) segment.

The high power WiFi module and [Power Line communication module](https://www.rakwireless.com/en-us/products/plc-boards-and-modules/lx200v30-plc-homeplug-av-module) is useful for data transfer during communications. While the first comes in use to gain access to WiFi module devices, the latter is useful in sending and receiving data over existing power cables.
