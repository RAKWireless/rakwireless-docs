    As water might become more scarce in many parts of the world, LoRa-based solutions have been provided to allow farmers manage their irrigation system more effectively. Hence, we need not worry about draught as this technology could save the soil during the “less rainy” days.

5. Monitoring of Cattle Health

    LoRa-equipped ear tags monitor the location and health of cattle increasing their yield and productivity.

6. Smart Soil Sensors

    LoRa based wireless sensors help detect Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK) levels in the soil. This will help farmers reduce waste and maximise crop yield.

7. Other Agricultural Applications

    Autonomous irrigation and presence of IoT networks in rural areas.

### Smart Cities
Wow, smart cities? Yes, smart cities. You may be wondering just how this would be possible. Well, the possibility of this is not farfetched as LoRaWAN is designed to improve everyday municipal operations.

Just by connecting services such as lighting, waste removal and many more, smart cities is very possible. Imagine a Sci-Fi movie with flying cars and all, well maybe not!

This technology is indeed, making the world a better place.

<b>The How</b>

1. Smart Bus Schedule

    This is good news for students and workers. In fact, commuters generally, as a LoRa-based solar powered display screen showing information, such as, the next bus departure, and an up-to-the-minute changes in schedule, is available. This saves commuters a lot of time.

2. Smart Street Lights

    A LoRa-based street lighting system reduces electricity costs to the barest minimum without affecting the city’s infrastructures and facilities. Let’s not forget that the fact that LoRa technology aims at low cost and low power makes this application effectively possible.

3. Smart Waste Management

    Normally, waste is disposed whether it is full or not.  But now, with LoRa technology, the capacities of waste can be evaluated, making waste management a lot easier.

4. Smart Parking

    LoRa technology is making it easy to deploy smart parking spaces. You now have the capacity to share your parking status with any LoRa-enabled device.

    This has transformed basic commercial and municipal parking spaces to smart spaces that can detect the absence, presence,  arrival and departure of a vehicle.

5. Other Smart city Applications

    Smart metering, smart water leakage detection, and smart flood sensors. All these to create a more resilient environment amongst many others.

6. Smart Environment

    Of what use will this technology be, if it is not designed to create a better environment?

    The environment constitutes an important aspect of living, and, LoRaWAN technology has the ability to achieve a smarter environment by monitoring flood sensors, natural disaster communications, monitoring of water systems and protecting endangered species.

    For instance, LoRa equipped sensors have been placed in black Rhinos to monitor their movements and activities.

### Smart Healthcare

LoRa technology is suitable for critical smart healthcare applications by virtue of its low power and low cost and its ability to cover a wide range. LoRa technology is indeed, improving healthcare and livelihood.
