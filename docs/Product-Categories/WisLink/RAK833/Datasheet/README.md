## Overview

### Description

The **RAK833 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator** is a family of LoRa® concentrator modules with mini PCIe form factor based on SX1301, which enables an easy integration into an existing routers and other network equipments with gateway capabilities.This can be used in any embedded platform offering a free mini-PCIe slot with USB and SPI connectivity.

RAK833 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator is a complete and cost efficient gateway solution offering up to 10 programmable parallel demodulation paths. It is targeted at smart metering fixed networks and Internet of Things applications with up to 500 nodes per square kilometer (km²) in moderately interfered environment. These modules have the industry standard PCI Express Mini Card form factor which enables easy integration into an application board.

### Product Features

- Full LoRaWAN® 1.0.2 stack support
- Compact size in the form of a mPCIe 52pin form factor card
- SX1301 base band processor emulates 49 x LoRa® demodulators, 10 parallel demodulation paths. It supports 8 uplinks channel and 1 downlink channel.
- Max Tx Power of 20dBm
- RX sensitivity of -136dBm
- Compatible with 3.3V mPCIe type slots, common for 3G/LTE modules
- With an option for SPI interface board or both SPI and USB interfaces
- Perfect for a Plug-and-Play Setup when used together with the mPCIe to USB adapter (check this option above to include the board)

### Hardware

The hardware is categorized into seven parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the parameters and standard values of the board in terms of electrical, mechanical, and environmental. 

#### Interfaces

##### GPS_PPS

The RAK833 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator includes the GPS_PPS input for received packets time-stamped. It integrates **one (1) SX1301** chip, **two (2) SX1255/7**, and other chip for RF signal, which represents the core of the device, providing the related LoRa® modem and processing functionalities. Additional signal conditioning circuitry is implemented for PCI Express Mini Card compliance, and one u.FL connectors are available for external antennas integration.

##### Module supply input

RAK833 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator must be supplied through the **3.3Vaux** pins by a DC power supply. The voltage must be stable, because during this operation the current drawn from 3.3Vaux can vary significantly based on the power consumption profile of the SX1301 chip (see [**SX1301 DS**](https://www.semtech.com/uploads/documents/sx1301.pdf) datasheet).

##### Antenna RF interfaces

The modules have one RF interface over a standard **U. FL connectors** (Hirose U. FL-R-SMT) with a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω. The RF port (ANT1) supports both Tx and Rx, providing the antenna interface.

##### SPI interface

An SPI interface is provided on the PCIe*SCK, PCIe* MISO, PCIe*MOSI, PCIe* CSN pins of the system connector. The SPI interface gives access to the configuration register of SX1301 via a synchronous full-duplex protocol. Only the slave side is implemented.

##### USB interface

:::warning ⚠️ WARNING
This feature is not available for RAK833-SPI version
:::

RAK833 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator can support the high speed USB to SPI by **FT2232H**, it includes a high-speed USB 2.0 compliant interface with maximum 480 Mb/s data rate, representing the interface for any communication with an external host application processor. The module itself acts as a USB device and can be connected to any USB host equipped with compatible drivers. For more information, please refer to the data sheet of [**FT2232H**](https://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/ICs/DS_FT2232H.pdf).

##### RESET

RAK833 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator includes the RESET active-high input signal to reset the radio operations as specified by the SX1301 Specification.

##### SPDT_SEL

RAK833 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator includes the SPDT_SEL input for selecting SPI or USB interface.

- SPDT_SEL="H", USB Port Enable,
- SPDT_SEL="L", SPI Port Enable.

#### Electrical Characteristics

##### Absolute Maximum Rating

Limiting values given below are in accordance with the Absolute Maximum Rating System (IEC 134).

:::warning ⚠️ WARNING
Stressing the device above one or more of the ratings listed in the Absolute Maximum Rating section may cause permanent damage. These are stress ratings only. Operating the module at these or at any conditions other than those specified in the Operating Conditions section of the specification should be avoided. Exposure to Absolute Maximum Rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

#### Reference Applications

The figure below shows the minimum application schematic of the RAK833 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator which uses at least **3.3V/1A DC power source**. It can either connect through the SPI interface or USB interface to the main processor. If the SPI interface is chosen, **SPDT_SEL** should be connected to the ground (GND) otherwise, leave the pin open.
