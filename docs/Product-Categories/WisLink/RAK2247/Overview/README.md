## Product Description

The **RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator** is a LoRaÂ® Concentrator module with mini-PCIe form factor based on the SX1301. This enables easy integration into routers and other networking equipment, adding gateway capabilities. The module can be used in any embedded platform offering a mini-PCIe slot with an SPI or USB connection.

Despite its small size this is an 8 channel concentrator module. By integrating it together with a computing core a fully fledged gateway solution can easily be created.

## Product Features

- Mini PCIe form factor, mounted heat-sink.
- SX1301 base band processor emulates 49 x LoRaÂ® demodulators, 10 parallel demodulation paths. It supports 8 uplinks channel and 1 downlink channel.
- 2 x SX125x Tx/Rx front-ends high/low frequency.
- Built-in FT2232H for SPI to USB 2.0 conversion (optional).
- Operates at 3.3 V, making it compatible with standard 3G/LTE card slots of Mini PCI-e type.
- Tx power up to 25 dBm, Rx sensitivity down to -139 dBm @ SF12, BW 125 kHz.
- Supports the LoRaWANÂ® 1.0.2 protocol.
- Supports global license-free frequency band (EU433, CN470, IN865, EU868, US915, AU915, KR920, AS920 and AS923).
