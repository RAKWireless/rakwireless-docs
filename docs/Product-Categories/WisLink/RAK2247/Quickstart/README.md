## Product Configuration

### RAK2247 + x86 Linux PC
This section explains the basic steps on how to interface the RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator with a Linux Operating System in a computer.

<!-- * The following devices are necessary for the interface:
  * RAK2247 WisLink LPWAN Concentrator
  * [mPCIe to USB Board](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/mpcie-to-usb-board) -->

1. Insert the RAK2247 mPCIe board into the USB carrier board and plugged into a free USB port of your PC. Your Linux PC should recognized it as a USB device.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 If you want to connect the **RAK2247 mPCIe board** to the **Linux PC** directly, make sure to have the PERST# signal (Pin 22) pulled down.

2. Open the command line then enter the command below in order to clone the Github repository that is required for the process to be completed:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RAKWireless/rak_common_for_gateway.git
```

3. Get the name of the interface you are using to connect to the internet by typing the command:

```sh
ifconfig
```

An example in Figure 2 shows the name of the wireless interface ‚Äú**wlx6045bdf0cf64**‚Äù.

* Enter the RAK Folder through:

```sh
cd rak_common_for_gateway/lora/rak2247_usb
```

4. Next, you need to insert the name you got in Step 3 for your interface in the following files:
    * rak_common_for_gateway/lora/set_eui.sh
    * rak_common_for_gateway/lora/update_gwid.sh
* Then, replace the following line:

```
GATEWAY_EUI_NIC=‚Äùeth0‚Äù
```

* With the line,

```
GATEWAY_EUI_NIC=‚Äùwlx6045bdf0cf64h0‚Äù
```

Again, the values are just an example. Remember to do this for all 3 files in step 4.

5. **Add** the following lines of code at the end of ‚Äú**install.sh**‚Äù file: ( In addition to inserting the name of the interface from the previous step)

```sh
cp ../set_eui.sh packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/
cp ../update_gwid.sh packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/
cp ../start.sh packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/
mkdir -p /opt/ttn-gateway/
cp -rf packet_forwarder /opt/ttn-gateway/
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 If you want packet forwarder to start on boot, you need to also add the lines below:
:::

```sh
cp ../ttn-gateway.service /lib/systemd/system/
systemctl enable ttn-gateway.service
```

6. Save ‚Äú**install.sh**‚Äù file and execute it in order to install: 

```sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

7.Wait for the installation to complete. Using the commands below, go and run the newly created process (**lora_pkt_fwd**):

```sh
cd /opt/ttn-gateway/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd 
sudo ./lora_pkt_fwd
```
:::tip üìù NOTE:
 If you added the additional lines in step 5 it will execute every time on boot.
:::

8. The regional parameter configurations for all the supported regions are located in the folder `</opt/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/global_conf>`. In case you need to adjust the region frequency band for example, do so before running the process (**EU868 is the default**)

**Congratulations!** :tada: you should now see your Gateway in TTN!
