## Product Description

RAK2011 WisLink Cellular BG96 Arduino Shield is a compact cellular communications module that supports Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWA) technology for networking Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. It can simultaneously support 2G, 4G/LTE, NB-IoT, and GPS, with an additional feature of Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) for high definition (HD) and uninterrupted voice calls.

This multitude of features allows users the flexibility of migrating from 2G to 4G/LTE. It requires no hardware change and improves power consumption, system capacity, and spectrum efficiency by utilizing the Narrow Band Internet-of-Things, tracking units through GPS and location-based services (LBS), staying on the 4G/LTE network even when making or receiving calls, and other networking features.

The RAK2011 is based on the Quectel BG96 module and comes with drivers for Windows, Linux, and Android support via AT commands. It supports networking protocols such as PPP, TCP, UDP, SSL, TLS, FTP(S), HTTP(S), NITZ, PING, and MQTT. This is useful for facilitating software development and system integration into any IoT application.

RAK2011 can be used as a development platform in tandem with external
microcontrollers/microprocessors-based platforms for IoT applications, or it can be used as a standalone device. It is in full compliance with FCC, CE, RoHS, and Japan TELEC/JATE.
