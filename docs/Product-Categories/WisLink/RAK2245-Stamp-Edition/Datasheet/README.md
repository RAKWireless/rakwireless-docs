## Overview

### Description

The **RAK2245 WisLink-LoRa Stamp Edition** is a complete and cost efficient gateway solution base on Semtech SX1301 fully utilizing the LoRa System. This LPWAN Concentrator module supports eight channels and is available for all LoRaWAN¬Æ international standard bands.

The Stamp form factor feature enables easy integration into the system's main board, providing LoRaWAN¬Æ functionality.This ultra compact module measures just 60mm x 30mm x 14.9mm, believed to be the world‚Äôs smallest gateway module which has a built-in GPS chip. It comes with a mounted heat-sink that improves the thermal heat dissipation and overall performance of the device.

Overall, this gateway module is the most economical way to create different solutions like smart grid, intelligent farm and other IoT applications. It is also ideal for manufacturing small series that can expand into more applications.

- 2 x SX125X TX/RX front-ends high/ low frequency.
- Supports 5 V power supply, integrated level conversion circuit.
- TX power up to 27dBm, RX sensitivity down to - 139dBm@SF12, BW 125KHz.
- Supports the LoRaWAN¬Æ 1.0.2 protocol.
- Supports global license-free frequency band (EU433, CN470, IN865, EU868, US915, AU915, KR920, AS920 and AS923).
- Supports SPI interface.
- Integrated the Ublox MAX-7Q GPS Module.

### Hardware

The hardware is categorized into five parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the parameters and standard values of the board in terms of electrical and environmental. 

#### Interfaces

The SX1301 digital baseband chip contains 10 programmable reception paths. These
paths have different levels of programmability and has a variety of cases. It is
important to understand the differences between those demodulation paths to make the
best possible use from the system.

##### Power Supply

RAK2245 WisLink-LoRa Stamp Edition is powered through 5V. It integrates the IOREF for
Level Translator, which can communicate with 3.3V, 1.8V and other different voltage
interfaces.

##### SPI Interface

The pin connector provides an SPI connection which allows direct access to the Sx1301 SPI interface. This gives the target system the possibility to use existing SPI interfaces to communicate with the module.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Please reset SX1301 via PIN A13 after turning on your RAK2245 WisLink-LoRa Stamp Edition
:::

##### UART and I¬≤C

UART and I¬≤C connections are also included on the pin connector. These connections allow direct access to the GPS module. The 1PPS is connected internally to SX1301.

##### Digital IOs

There are two digital IO PINs, which give the user an interface to reset the GPS module or set it into standby mode.

##### LEDs

3 x Green LED for indicating the status of PWR, TX, RX.

##### Antenna RF Interface

The modules have two RF interfaces for LoRa¬Æ and GPS antennas over the standard UFL connectors (Hirose U. FL-R-SMT). It has a characteristic impedance of 50 Œ© and supports both Tx and Rx via RF ports, providing the antenna interface.
