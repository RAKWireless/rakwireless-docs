## Product Configuration

### Accessing your Gateway

After burning the image into the SD Card, make sure you have inserted the SD Card with the Latest Firmware installed to the Raspberry Pi with the RAK2245 Stamp WisLink LPWAN Concentrator Concentrator Module and the LoRa¬Æ and GPS Antenna attached to it. After which, you can now safely power on the gateway. In this document, several ways in accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Before powering the Raspberry Pi you should install the LoRa¬Æ and GPS antennas. Not doing so might damage the boards.
:::

#### 1. Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the Gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find a SSID named like "**Rakwireless_XXXX**" on your PC Wi-Fi Network List.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wislink-lora/rak2245-stamp-edition/quickstart/accessing-your-gateway/m3gdql9punccouuquldw.jpg"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAKWireless Access Point"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE
Connect to this Wi-Fi SSID by using \"**rakwireless**\" as the default password. The default IP address of the Gateway's Wi-Fi is **`192.168.230.1`**. Take note of this IP address as this will be needed in connecting via SSH.
:::

#### 2. Via the Ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi 3B+

You can also connect your PC with the Gateway through an Ethernet cable. By default, the IP address of the Gateway‚Äôs Ethernet interface is `192.168.10.10`, so you need to set the IP address of your PC‚Äôs Ethernet to the same network segment, for example, `192.168.10.20`_._

- To do this in Windows, go to Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center and Click **Ethernet**

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wislink-lora/rak2245-stamp-edition/quickstart/accessing-your-gateway/ncj0nh5ynyywotognquj.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Network and Sharing Center"
/>

- Click **Properties** then Choose **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4).**

### Connect the Gateway with ChirpStack

The ChirpStack or previously known as LoRaServer project provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN¬Æ networks. You can learn more about ChirpStack [**here**](https://www.chirpstack.io/)

For the RAK2245 Stamp WisLink LPWAN Concentrator Concentrator Module, there are 2 ways to use the ChirpStack:

#### 1. Using the built-in ChirpStack

There is a built-in ChirpStack in every RAK Developer gateway if you use the latest firmware.

- When you use it for the first time after burning the latest firmware, the Gateway will work in the EU868 Band and use the built-in ChirpStack as its default LoRa¬Æ Server. If you don't want to change the frequency or LoRa¬Æ Server, you don't have to do anything as this will be configured automatically when the gateway boots.
- However if it is not the first time and you want to use the built-in ChirpStack as the LoRa¬Æ Server, follow the steps discussed in [Configuring the Gateway](/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2245-Stamp-Edition/Quickstart/#configuring-the-gateway) section.
- **Optional:** If ever you disabled the AP Mode and you have connected it to your own Wifi network (Client Mode). You can search for your gateway‚Äôs IP Address via [**Advanced IP Scanner**](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/). Copy the IP Address of your Gateway, it should have a Manufacturer name of **Raspberry Pi Foundation**:

<rk-img

  width="100%"
  caption="IP address of your RAK2245 Stamp WisLink LPWAN Concentrator using IP Scanner"
/>

There is a Web-based UI that comes with the ChirpStack instance. Simply open a browser and enter the following credentials:

- **Browser Address**: "Gateway IP Address:8080" (**Example**: http://192.168.254.176:8080)
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
It is advisable to change your password to tighten the security of your account. You can change this by clicking the \"change password\" button at the user icon.
