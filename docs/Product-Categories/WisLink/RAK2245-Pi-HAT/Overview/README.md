## Product Description

**RAK2245 Pi HAT** is a module with Raspberry PI form factor. It can be plugged into
Raspberry PI such as Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ as a complete RF front end of gateway. It supports eight channels and is available for LoRaWANÂ® global frequency bands. The board is the smallest gateway concentrator which integrates the **Ublox MAX-7Q GPS Module** and heat sink.

The board can provide low data rate LoRaÂ® radio links in ultra-fast speed. It is powered by a **Semtech SX1301** transceiver concentrator that is capable of managing packets from many remotely dispersed end-points. Two Semtech SX125X are integrated for RF front end I/Q transceivers.

The RAK2245 Pi HAT is a complete and cost efficient gateway solution that can help you develop a full LoRaÂ® system. This is an economical way to create different solutions like smart grid, intelligent farm and other IoT applications. It is also ideal for manufacturing small series that can expand into more applications.
