## Product Configuration

### Accessing your Gateway

After burning the image into the SD Card, make sure you have inserted the SD Card with the Latest Firmware installed to the **Raspberry Pi 3B+ / 4 with the RAK2245 Pi Hat LPWAN Concentrator Module** and the LoRa¬Æ and GPS Antenna attached to it. After which, you can now safely power on the gateway. In this document, several ways in accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
Before powering the Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4 you should install the LoRa¬Æ and GPS antennas. Not doing so might damage the boards.
:::

#### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the Gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find an SSID named like "**Rakwireless_XXXX**" on your PC Wi-Fi Network List.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wislink-lora/rak2245-pi-hat-edition/quickstart/4.accessing-your-gateway/wifi.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="RAKwireless Access Point"

### Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack

The ChirpStack or previously known as LoRaServer project provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN¬Æ networks. You can learn more about ChirpStack [here](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

For the RAK2245 Pi HAT Edition LPWAN Gateway Concentrator Module, there are 2 ways to use the ChirpStack:

#### 1. Using the built-in ChirpStack
There is a built-in ChirpStack in every RAK Developer gateway if you use the latest firmware.

* When you use it for the first time after burning the latest firmware, the Gateway will work in the EU868 Band and use the built-in ChirpStack as its default LoRa¬Æ Server. If you don't want to change the frequency or LoRa¬Æ Server, you don't have to do anything as this will be configured automatically when the Gateway boots.
* However if it is not the first time and you want to use the built-in ChirpStack as the LoRa¬Æ Server, follow the steps discussed in [Configuring the Gateway](/Product-Categories/WisLink/RAK2245-Pi-HAT/Quickstart/#configuring-the-gateway) the Gateway section.
* **Optional**: If ever you disabled the AP Mode and you have connected it to your own Wifi network (Client Mode). You can search for your gateway‚Äôs IP Address via [**Advanced IP Scanner**](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/). Copy the IP Address of your Gateway, it should have a Manufacturer name of **Raspberry Pi Foundation**:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wislink-lora/rak2245-pi-hat-edition/quickstart/8.connecting-to-chirpstack/advanced-ip-scanner.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="IP address of your Raspbery Pi with the RAK2245 Pi Hat using IP Scanner"
/>

* There is a Web-based UI that comes with the ChirpStack instance. Simply open a browser and enter the following credentials:
    * **Browser Address**: `<Gateway IP address>:8080` (**Example**: http://192.168.254.176:8080)
    * **Username**: admin
    * **Password**: admin

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
 It is advisable to change your password to tighten the security of your account. You can change this by clicking the "**change password**" button at the user icon.
