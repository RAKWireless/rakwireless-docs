## Overview

### Description

**RAK2245 Pi HAT** is a module with Raspberry PI form factor. It can be plugged into
Raspberry PI such as Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ as a complete RF front end of gateway. It supports eight channels and is available for LoRaWAN¬Æ global frequency bands. The board is the smallest gateway concentrator which integrates the **Ublox MAX-7Q GPS Module** and heat sink.

The board can provide low data rate LoRa¬Æ radio links in ultra-fast speed. It is powered by a **Semtech SX1301** transceiver concentrator that is capable of managing packets from many remotely dispersed end-points. Two Semtech SX125X are integrated for RF front end I/Q transceivers.

The RAK2245 Pi HAT is a complete and cost efficient gateway solution that can help you develop a full LoRa¬Æ system. This is an economical way to create different solutions like smart grid, intelligent farm and other IoT applications. It is also ideal for manufacturing small series that can expand into more applications.

### Features

- Compatible with Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ edition.
- Integrated Ublox MAX-7Q GPS Module and heat sink.
- SX1301 base band processor, emulates 49 x LoRa¬Æ demodulators, 10 parallel
  demodulation paths, supports 8 uplink / 1 downlink channels.
- 2 units of SX125x Tx/Rx front-ends for high/ low frequency.
- Supports 5V power supply, integrated level conversion circuit.
- TX power up to 27dBm, RX sensitivity down to -139dBm@SF12, BW 125KHz.
- Supports latest LoRaWAN¬Æ 1.0.2 protocol.
- Supports global license-free frequency band (EU433, CN470, EU868, US915, AS923, AU915, KR920, IN865 and AS920).
- Supports SPI, UART, I2C interface.

### Hardware

The hardware is categorized into five parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the parameters and standard values of the board in terms of electrical and environmental. 

#### Interface

The SX1301 digital baseband chip contains **ten (10) programmable reception paths**. Those
paths have differentiated levels of programmability and allow different use cases. It is
important to understand the differences between those demodulation paths to make the
best possible use from the system.

##### Power Supply

RAK2245 Pi HAT module is powered through **5V or 3.3V power pins**.

##### SPI Interface

The pin connector provides an SPI connection which allows direct access to the
Sx1301 SPI interface. This gives the target system the possibility to use existing SPI interfaces to communicate with the module.

:::tip üìù NOTE
Please reset SX1301 via PIN 11 after turning on RAK2245 Pi HAT.
:::

##### UART and I¬≤C

UART and I2C connections are also included on the pin connector. These connections
allow direct access to the GPS module. The 1PPS is connected internally to SX1301.

##### Digital IOs

There are two digital IO PINs, which give the user an interface to reset the GPS module or set it into standby mode.

##### LEDs

There are **three (3) Green LED** that indicates the status of PWR, TX, RX.

##### Antenna RF Interface

The modules have two RF interfaces for LoRa¬Æ and GPS antennas over the standard UFL connectors (Hirose U. FL-R-SMT). It has a characteristic impedance of 50OHM and supports both Tx and Rx via RF ports, providing the antenna interface.

#### Pin Definition

The pin connector of RAK2245 Pi HAT is located at the bottom side. Refer to the diagram and table below for the description and numbering of each pins.

##### Absolute Maximum Rating

The values and range given below are all in accordance with Absolute Maximum Rating System (IEC 134)

| Parameter             | Description       | Min.  | Typ. | Max    |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----- | ---- | ------ |
| Supply Voltage (VDD)  | Input DC Voltage  | -0.3V | 5.0V | 5.5V   |
| Operating Temperature | Temperature Range | -40¬∞C |      | +85¬∞C  |
| RF Input Power        |                   |       |      | -15dBm |

:::tip üìù NOTE
With RF output power level above +15 dBm a minimum distance to a transmitter should be 1m for avoiding too large input level.
