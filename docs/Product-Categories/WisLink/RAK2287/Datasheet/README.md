## Overview

### Description

**RAK2287** is an LPWAN Concentrator Module with mini-PCIe form factor based on Semtech SX1302, which enables an easy integration into an existing router or other network equipment with LPWAN Gateway capabilities. It can be used in any embedded platform offering a free mini-PCIe slot with SPI connection. Furthermore, **ZOE-M8Q GPS chip** is integrated on board.

This module is an exceptional, complete and cost efficient gateway solution offering up to 10 programmable parallel demodulation paths, an 8 x 8 channel LoRa® packet detectors, 8 x SF5-SF12 LoRa® demodulators and 8 x SF5-SF10 LoRa® demodulators. It is capable of detecting uninterrupted combination of packets at 8 different spreading factors and 10 channels with continuous demodulation of up to 16 packets. This product is best for smart metering fixed networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, that can cover of up to 500 nodes per km² in an environment of moderate interference.

## Specifications

### Overview

The overview shows the top and back view of the RAK2287 board. It also presents the block diagram that discusses how the board works. 

#### Board Overview

RAK2287 is a compact LPWAN Gateway Module, making it suitable for integration in systems where mass and size constraints are essential. It has been designed with the PCI Express Mini Card form factor in mind, so it can easily become a part of products that comply with the standard, where they allow for cards with thickness of at least 10.5 mm.

The board has two UFL interfaces for the LoRa® and GNSS antennas and a standard 52 pin connector (mPCIe).

#### Block Diagram

RAK2287 card is equipped with one SX1302 chip and two SX1250. The first chip is utilized for RF signal and the core of the device. While the latter, provides the related LoRa® modem and processing functionalities. Additional signal conditioning circuitry is implemented for PCI Express Mini Card compliance, and one UFL connectors are available for external antennas integration.

### Hardware

The hardware is categorized into seven parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the parameters and standard values of the board. 

#### Interface

##### Power Supply

RAK2287 card must be supplied through the 3.3Vaux pins by a DC power supply. The voltage needs to be stable since the current drawn can vary significantly during operation based on the power consumption profile of the SX1302 chip (see [SX1302 Datasheet](https://www.mouser.com/pdfDocs/Semtech_08072019_DS_SX1302_V10-1626824.pdf))

##### SPI Interface

SPI interface mainly provides for the Host_SCK, Host_MISO, Host_MOSI, Host_CSN pins of the system connector. The SPI interface gives access to the configuration register of SX1302 via a synchronous full-duplex protocol. Only the slave side is implemented.

##### UART and I2C Interface

RAK2287 integrates ZOE-M8Q GPS module which has UART and I2C interface. The PINs on golden finger provide an UART connection and an I2C connection, which allows direct access to the GPS module. The PPS signal is not only connected to SX1302 internally, but also connected to golden finger which can be used by host board.

##### GPS_PPS

RAK2287 card includes
the GPS_PPS input for received packets time-stamped.

##### RESET

RAK2287 card includes the RESET active-high input signal to reset the radio operations as specified by the SX1302 Specification[.](#_bookmark73)

##### Antenna RF Interface

The modules have one RF interfaces over a standard UFL connectors (Hirose U. FL-R-SMT) with a characteristic impedance of 50Ω. The RF port (J1) supports both Tx and Rx, providing the antenna interface.

::: tip 📝 NOTE
Although this module is designed to be as robust as possible, electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage this module. This module must be protected at all times from ESD when handling or transporting. Static charges may easily produce potentials of several kilovolts on the human body or equipment, which can discharge without detection. Industry-standard ESD handling precautions should be used at all times.
