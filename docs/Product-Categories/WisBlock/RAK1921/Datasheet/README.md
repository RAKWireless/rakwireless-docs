# RAK1921 WisBlock OLED Display Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK1921 module part of the WisBlock series, is one of the modules that belong to the accessory category. This module was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way. As part of the accessory category, it is not mandatory to be part of the final solution, but for certain cases can provide competitive advantages and improves the usability of the final solution. 

RAK1921 is an OLED display module with a 128√ó64 dot matrix. The main characteristics of this module are: high brightness, self-emission, high contrast ratio, slim/thin outline, wide viewing angle, wide temperature range, and low power consumption.


### Features

- Dot Matrix: **128√ó64**
- Driver IC: **SSD1306**
- Interface: **IIC**
- Wide range of operating temperature: **-30¬∞‚Äì70¬∞ C**
- Compatible RAK5005-O header interface

## Specifications
### Overview
#### Mounting

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into four parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts, and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK1921 WisBlock OLED Display.


#### Interfaces

The RAK1921 module is compatible with RAK5005-O WisBoard baseboard. The RAK5005-O has reserved a dedicated I2C port with a 2.54mm header, as shown in the red rectangle in Figure below, in which the RAK1921 can be attached.
