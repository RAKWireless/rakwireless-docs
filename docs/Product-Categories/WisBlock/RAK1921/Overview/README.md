## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK1921** you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK1921** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.   

**RAK1921** does not occupy the **WisBlock IO** slot of the **WisBlock Base**. Instead it is plugged into a separate connector. This connector is a standard 2.54mm header and needs to be soldered to the **WisBlock Base** board.
