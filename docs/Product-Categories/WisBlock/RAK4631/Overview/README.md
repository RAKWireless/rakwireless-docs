## Product Description

**RAK4631** is a **WisBlock Core** module for RAK **WisBlock**. It extends the **WisBlock** series with a powerful Nordic nRF52840 MCU that supports Bluetooth 5.0 (Bluetooth Low Energy) and the newest LoRa transceiver from Semtech, the SX1262. The Semtech SX1262 has compared to the older SX127x series a lower power consumption at the same TX power. This makes the **RAK4631** an ultra-low power communication solution.
**RAK4631** can be comfortably programmed with the Arduino™ IDE or the PlatformIO extension for other IDE's like Atom, MS Visual Code, or Clion.

Both LoRaWan® and LoRa point to point connections are supported by an Arduino™ library.


## Product Features
 
* Nordic nRF52840 ultra-low power MCU    
* 32-bit ARM® Cortex™-M4 CPU    
* 64&nbsp;MHz CPU clock    
* 1&nbsp;MB Flash, 256 KB RAM    
* Semtech SX1262 low power high range LoRa transceiver     
* LoRaWan® 1.0.2 protocol stack     
* Bluetooth 5.0 protocol stack    
<!-- * 8 Mbit nonvolatile NOR FLASH memory      -->
* I2C, SPI, Analog inputs, Digital inputs, and outputs    
* Low power consumption

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK4631**, you need at least a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK4631** module and has the programming/debug interface.   

:::warning ⚠️ WARNING    
- Make sure to fix the module with the screws to ensure a proper function.
- When using the LoRa or Bluetooth Low Energy transceivers, make sure that always an antenna is connected. Using these transceivers without an antenna can damage the system.
