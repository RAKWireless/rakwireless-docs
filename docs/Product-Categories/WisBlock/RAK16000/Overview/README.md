## Product Description

RAK16000 is a part of the WisBlock Sensor Series that is capable of measuring DC current in the range of 0 to 3&nbsp;A in a voltage range of 0 to 26&nbsp;V. With the two measured DC values, you get the power consumption by multiplying the current and voltage. Additionally, this module uses the INA219BID from Texas Instruments that offers high accuracy maximum rate of 0.5% over temperature.


## Product Features

* **Module Specifications**

  * Measure DC current in the range of 0 to 3&nbsp;A
  * Measure DC voltage in the range of 0 to 26&nbsp;V
  * High accuracy of 0.5% (max) over temperature (INA219B)
  * 100&nbsp;mΩ shunt resistor can provide a resolution of up to 0.1&nbsp;mA
  * I2C interface
  * 3.3&nbsp;V Power Supply

* **Module Size**
    * 15 x 25&nbsp;mm
