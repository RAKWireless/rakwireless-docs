## Product Description

<!---
The RAK5005-O baseboard has a one slot reserved for WisDuo moduleÔºåfour slots for WisSensor modules and one slot for WisIO module. Also, there are also **2.54 mm pitch connectors** for extension interface, such as **I2C**, **UART**, and **GPIO pins**.

For convenience, there is a USB connector for debugging, it is connected directly to MCU‚Äôs USB port (if supported). The customer can access the internal MCU by connecting to a computer‚Äôs USB port directly. This USB connector is also used as a battery charging port.

For each module, a method is designed to connect and fasten the module easily. These connectors are **high-speed board to board connector**, they provide signal integrity for each data bus. A set of screws are used for attaching the module under the environment with vibrations.

To avoid electromagnetic interference and heating interference, the sensor connectors on the WisBase are designed to be installed on both sides of the PCB. Moreso, a sensor module can be attached either on the top layer or the bottom layer of the WisBase board.

**RAK5005-O** is the base board that connects all **WisBlock** modules together. It creates the power supply for attached **WisBlock Core**, **WisBlock Sensor** and **WisBlock IO** modules.

**RAK5005-O** is as well the mounting base when you put your solution into a case. RAK5005-O has connectors for

* 1 WisBlock Core processing module
* 1 WisBlock IO extension module
* 4 WisBlock Sensor modules
* 1 USB for programming and debugging
* 3.7V Rechargable battery
* 5V Solar panel
* I2C, UART, GPIO's and analog input accessible with solder contacts

It has as well two user definable LED‚Äôs and one power supply/charging indicator LED and a reset button

## Product Features

* **Power supply**     
    * **RAK5005-O** supports both 5V USB and 3.7V rechargeable battery as power supply. In addition, it has a connector for a 5V solar panel to recharge the battery in a remote solution.     
    * Control of power consumption    
    * **RAK5005-O** has an electronic power switch for the supply to the **WisBlock Sensor** and **WisBlock IO** slots. The power supply for some of the **WisBlock Sensor** boards and most of the **WisBlock IO** extension boards can be controlled by the **WisBlock Core** modules application.    

* **Size**    
    * **RAK5005-O** has a size of only 30 x 60mm which lets you create solutions that fits into smallest housings.


## Prerequisites 

WisBlock Base is amazingly easy to use and requires only a USB cable to start developing with the system..

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING    
- Only 3.7-4.2V Rechargable LiPo batteries are supported. Do not use other types of batteries with the system.    
- Only 5V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.    
- Make sure the battery wires are matching the polarity on the RAK5005-O board. Not all batteries have the same wiring.
