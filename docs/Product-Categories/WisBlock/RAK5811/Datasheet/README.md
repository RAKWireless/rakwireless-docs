# RAK5811 WisBlock 0-5V Interface Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK5811 WisBlock IO module, was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way and must be combined with a WisBlock Core and a Base module. RAKWireless has standardized the way modules are interconnected to the baseboards with the WisBlock IO Connectors. This standard connector is a small high-density connector that not only saves spaces on the circuit boards but also allows to implement high-speed communication bus.

The RAK5811 is 0-5V analog input interface module. The signal is routed through the IO bus to the WisBlock Core module. Inside of the WisBlock Core module, the MCU digitizes the signal and the sampled data is transmitted, for example, via a LoRa transceiver.

The RAK5811 module features two input channels of 0-5V analog signals. Inside, a high-precision operational amplifier, which supports a wide range of operating temperatures, is used for signal amplification and conversion.

In addition, this module integrates a 12V power supply which can be used to power the external sensors. The connection of the 0-5V sensors is done through the fast crimping terminal without the need for special tools, this simplifies the installation process on the field.


### Features 

*	Two 0-5V analog input channels.

## Specifications

### Overview

The overview shows the realistic view of the RAK5811 module and its block diagram. It also covers the installation mechanism of the module into the baseboard.

#### Block Diagram

In the RAK5811 module, as shown in Figure 1, the 0-5V input signal is connected to operational amplifier by the R1/R2 voltage divider. The operational amplifier output is routed to an analog input of the MCU to be digitalized by an internal ADC. Once the signal is digitalized, the user can recover the original voltage value by applying the following relation:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak5811/datasheet/voltage-divider.png"
  width="15%"
  caption="Voltage divider relation"
/>

Where Vout is the WisBlock Core read voltage, Vin is the analog input voltage (0-5V). From the voltage divider R1 is 1M Œ© and R2 is 1.5M Œ©, so the final relationship is: **Vin = Vout / 0.6**.

As shown in Figure 1, the module provides an output of 12V to power industrial sensors. This 12V output is boosted by an internal DC-DC booster. The enable pin allows to control the power conversion module and sets the RAK5811 module into a low power consumption mode. 

#### Installation 

##### Mounting Sketch

The RAK5811 module is part of the WisBlock IO category, which connects to the baseboard through the IO slot. The installation method is shown in Figure 2:

1. Keep the RAK5811 module parallel to the baseboard, and gently place and plug the WisConnector into the IO slot receptacle of the baseboard. The IO slot has an outer silkscreen to assist with the alignment. At this point, apply force evenly along the module and press again. There will be a sound to confirm the successful completion of the attachment process

##### RAK5811 Sensor Connector Crimping Mechanism

The RAK5811 features a fast-crimping terminal connector to simplify and ensure the wiring process on the fields. The crimping terminal can support cable with a width between 20 AWG to 24 AWG. The usual stripping length is around 6 to 7 mm. 

As shown in Figure 5, during the crimping process, the user should first press down and maintain the spring head of the crimping terminal firmly, then insert the stripped cable head into the corresponding connector‚Äôs hole. Once inserted correctly, then release the spring head, and the crimping process is completed.

## WisBlock Compatability

In the ecosystem of the WisBlock, the philosophy is to allow users to combine a WisBlock module of one category with WisBlock module of other categories. This is true in most of cases but it‚Äôs important to review the compatibility matrix when designing a customized solution. The RAK5811 module are as shown in the Table below:

:::tip üìù NOTE 1:  The RAK5801+RAK4601
The RAK5811 is not compatible with RAK4601. The main reason is because RAK4601 doesn‚Äôt expose any ADC pin through the RAK5005-O baseboard.
:::

:::tip üìù NOTE 2:  RAK5801+RAK4202+RAK5005-O
In order to combine a RAK5811 module, a RAK4202 which is a WisBlock Core module, and the RAK5005-O, the following modification must be introduced: 
- In RAK5005-O, remove the R7. The R7 resistor is shown in **Figure 11**.
- In RAK5811, remove R94 to R95, and use PA0 of STM32L151 to read the analog data of the channel ‚Äúanalog0‚Äù, and use PA2 of STM32L151 to read the analog data of Channel analog1. **Figure 12** shows the resistors R94 and R95 on the RAK5811 module.

This combination has the following restrictions: 
- The adapted RAK5005-O will not support battery power collection.
