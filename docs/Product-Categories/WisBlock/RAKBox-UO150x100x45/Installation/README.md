## Assembly Guide

### 1. Prepare the Lid and Gasket

First, install the rubber gasket in the groove of the top cover, as shown in **Figure 2**. Put the four corners of the gasket into the groove, and then press the middle gently. Ensure that the gasket is not twisted.

Before assembly, check if the gasket is installed correctly. The rubber gasket helps seal the enclosure properly and protects it from dust and water.

### 2. Choose the Internal Mounting Plate

Next is to prepare the mounting plate. There are two types of mounting plates:

- Plain mounting plate
- WisBlock bespoke mounting plate

#### Plain Mounting Plate

The plain mounting plate has no holes, except for mounting holes to the enclosure. It is designed to be customized depending on the circuit board to be placed in the enclosure.

  width="50%"
  caption="Plain mounting plate"

#### WisBlock Bespoke Mounting Plate

The WisBlock Bespoke Mounting Plate is designed specifically to hold WisBlock Base boards. You have to cut the excess bosses or parts with a wire cutter depending on the WisBlock Base board that you have.

The following guide shows what to cut depending on the WisBlock Base board.

::: tip 📝 NOTE
For the cutting reference, the red line is the cut-out area.

::: tip 📝 NOTE
Confirm the number of magnets according to the weight of the device. The medium and large unify enclosures support up to 6 magnets.
:::

:::warning ⚠️ WARNING
- Avoid placing the enclosure too high or in an environment that vibrates, shocks, or is unstable because doing so could result in equipment damage or physical injury.
- The effect of magnet adsorption is related to the material of adsorption position, surface spraying thickness, and roughness, so it can only be used after confirming that the installation effect is not a problem. If the surface condition of the installation position is not good, it may also affect the reliability of the magnet installation.
- When the enclosure is fixed on the desk by magnetic suction, do not push it back and forth artificially, otherwise, the coating on the contact surface will be damaged.
- During installation, pay attention to the fixation of the external cable of the device to avoid falling off the enclosure due to the excessive weight of the external cable, resulting in personal injury or equipment damage.
- Do not put the magnet close to the magnetic card and other products, or else the stored content of the product may be erased.
- Do not put the magnet close to the computer and other electronic equipment susceptible to the magnetic field, otherwise, it may cause electronic equipment-related failure.

| :---: | :--------: | :-------: | :------: | :--------------: |
|   1   | 20&nbsp;mm | 3&nbsp;mm |  NdFeB   | 2800 Gauss (TBD) |

:::warning ⚠️ WARNING
Handle with care to avoid personal injury or damage to the magnet.
