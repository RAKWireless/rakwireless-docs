# RAK5804 WisBlock IO Extension Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description


The RAK5804 WisBlock IO module, was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way and must be combined with a WisBlock Core and a Base module. 

The RAK5804 module is designed as an IO extension module that allow users to connect their own digital or analog devices or sensors to create a customized IoT solution. These sensors are connected through two expansion connectors: J2 and J3. In order to provide power to peripheral devices, 3.3V can be obtained from these expansion connectors. Internal protections allow to shut down the power supply when a short circuit is detected in the peripheral devices. Overcurrent cases are protected through internal PTC thermistors in the power supply circuit.

In addition, the RAK5804 module also supports a USB interface, which can be used with RAK5005-O to access the USB port of MCU of the WisBlock Core module of the solution. 

All external expansion interfaces of the RAK5804 module are equipped with TVS protection circuit to avoid damaging the mainboard and WisBlock Core circuit with ESD when users plug in or unplug to the expansion interfaces.

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into four parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts, and its corresponding functions and diagrams of the module. It also covers the electrical and mechanical characteristics that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK5804 WisBlock™ Module.

#### Interfaces

The RAK5804 module exposes to the user’s application the IO pins, the I2C and the UART communication ports through the J2, J3, and J4 connectors. Users can use these ports to connect sensors, digital I/O, analog I/O and slave devices. These ports are routed to the WisBlock Core through the IO connector.
