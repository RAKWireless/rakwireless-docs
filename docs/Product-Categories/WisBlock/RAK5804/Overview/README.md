## Product Description

**RAK5804** is a **WisBlock IO** module which extends the **WisBlock** system with additional analog and digital interfaces. In addition, it provides an USB interface.   

The interface is available through the two expansion connectors: **J2** and **J3**. To provide power to peripheral devices, the **3.3V** can be obtained from these expansion connectors. Internal protections allow shutting down the power supply when a short circuit is detected in the peripheral devices. Overcurrent cases are protected through **internal PTC thermistors** in the power supply circuit.    

Also, the **RAK5804** module supports a USB interface, which can be used with **RAK5005-O** to access the USB port of MCU of the **WisBlock Core** module of the solution.     

All external expansion interfaces of the **RAK5804** module are equipped with a TVS protection circuit to avoid damaging the mainboard and **WisBlock Core** circuit with ESD when users plug in or unplug the interface.

<!--
The RAK5804 module is part of the WisBlock series that belongs to the WisIO category. This module was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way and must be combined with a WisCore and a WisBase module. 

The RAK5804 module is designed as an IO extension module that allows you to connect their own digital or analog devices or sensors to create a customized IoT solution. These sensors are connected through the two expansion connectors: **J2** and **J3**. To provide power to peripheral devices, the **3.3V** can be obtained from these expansion connectors. Internal protections allow shutting down the power supply when a short circuit is detected in the peripheral devices. Overcurrent cases are protected through **internal PTC thermistors** in the power supply circuit.  

Also, the RAK5804 module supports a USB interface, which can be used with RAK5005 to access the USB port of MCU of the WisCore module of the solution. 

All external expansion interfaces of the RAK5804 module are equipped with a TVS protection circuit to avoid damaging the mainboard and WisCore circuit with ESD when users plug in or unplug the interface.
