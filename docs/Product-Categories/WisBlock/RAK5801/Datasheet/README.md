# RAK5801 WisBlock 4-20mA Interface Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK5801 WisBlock IO module, was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way and must be combined with a WisBlock Core and a Base module. 

The RAK5801 is a 4-20mA current loop extension module that allows the users to make a IoT solution for analog sensors with 4-20mA interface. This module converts the 4-20mA current signal into voltage range supported by the WisBlock Core module (MCU) for further digitalization and data transmission.

The RAK5801 module features two input channels of 4-20mA. Inside, a high precision operational amplifier is used for signal amplification and conversion and supports a wide range of operating temperatures. 

This module integrates a 12V power supply, which can be used  to power external sensors. The RAK5801 can be connected to 2-wire, 3-wire or 4-wire types of 4-20mA sensor. The module external interface is reached by a fast crimping terminal that allow connection for the 4-20mA sensors (including power) and to I2C bus. The fast crimping terminals  can be used without the need of special tools, which simplifies the installation process on the field.

### Features

## Specifications

### Overview


The overview discusses the block diagram of the board. It also shows the installation mechanism on how to mount the board into the baseboard.


#### Block Diagram

The RAK5801 module was designed to convert 4-20mA current signals into voltage signals by applying a sampling resistor. As shown in Figure 1, the input current signal from the sensor is conditioned by an operational amplifier to match the level supported by the ADC input of an MCU where the signal is digitized.

/>

Once the signal is digitalized, the user can recover the original current value by applying the following formula:

``I = U/149``

Where **U** is the ADC reading and **I** the sensor current.

As shown in Figure 1, the module provides an output of 12V for powering passive 4-20mA sensors. This 12V output is boosted by an internal DC-DC booster. The enable pin allows to control the power conversion module and set the RAK5801 module into a low power consumption mode. 


#### Installation

##### Mounting Mechanism

The RAK5801 module is part of the WisBlock IO category, which connects to the baseboard through the IO slot. The installation method is shown in the Figure 2.

1. Keep the RAK5801 module parallel to the baseboard, and gently place and plug  WisConnector into the IO slot receptacle of the baseboard. The IO slot has an outer silkscreen on it to assist with the alignment. At this point, apply force evenly along the module and press again. There will be a sound to confirm the successful completion of the attachment process.

##### RAK5801 Fast Crimping Terminal Mechanism

The RAK5801 features a fast-crimping terminal connector to simplify and ensure the wiring process on the fields. The fast-crimping terminal can support cable with a width between 20 AWG to 24 AWG. The usual stripping length is around 6 to 7 mm. 

As shown in Figure 4, during the crimping process, the user should first press down and maintain the spring head of the crimping terminal firmly, then insert the stripped cable head into the corresponding connector‚Äôs hole. Once inserted correctly, then release the spring head, and the crimping process is completed.

## WisBlock Compatability


Since a WisBlock module can be combined with a variety of different functional modules, the pin functions of the MCU are multiplexed, so the interface expansion module for each specific function may need to be properly adapted for the WisBlock. The compatibility details of the RAK5801 module are as shown in the Table below:

| **WisBlock Module** | **Adaptable Module** | **Description** | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| WisBase Base board | RAK5005/RAK5005-O | RAK5801 is designed to be assembled in the IO slot of RAK5005-O baseboard. | 
| WisBlock Core Module | RAK4631 | RAK5801 is compatible with RAK4631. | 
|  | RAK4201 | Please select RAK4201L-ADC for the low band or RAK4201H-ADC for the high band. | 
|  | RAK4202 | Please refer to Note 2 for hardware adaptions to the RAK5005-O and RAK5801. | 
|  | RAK4261 | Please refer to Note 3 for hardware adaptions to the RAK5005-O and RAK5801. | 

:::tip üìù NOTE 1:  The RAK5801+RAK4601
The RAK5801 is not compatible with RAK4601. The main reason is because RAK4601 doesn‚Äôt expose any ADC pin through the RAK5005-O baseboard.
:::

:::tip üìù NOTE 2:  RAK5801+RAK4202+RAK5005-O
In order to combine a RAK5801 module, a RAK4202 (WisBlock Core module), and the RAK5005-O, the following modification must be introduced: 
-	In RAK5005-O, remove the R7. The R7 resistor is shown in **Figure 11.**
-	In RAK5801, remove R94 to R95, and use PA0 of STM32L151 to read the analog data of the channel ‚Äúanalog0‚Äù, and use PA2 of STM32L151 to read the analog data of Channel analog1. **Figure 12** shows the resistors R94 and R95 on the RAK5801 module.

This combination has the following restrictions: 
-	The adapted RAK5005-O module will not able to sense the battery voltage anymore.
