## Introduction

WisBlock is an amazing product built by RAKwireless for the IoT industry. Its building blocks approach allows you to quickly realize your idea, and through high-speed connectors and fasteners interconnection, it is ideal to create reliable, industry-grade products.

WisBlock consists of WisBlock Base, WisBlock Core, WisBlock Sensor, and WisBlock IO.

RAK5005-O is the WisBlock Base board which can be connected with WisBlock Core and WisBlock IO through the connector of the board and provides direct data bus interconnection. WisBlock Base module also integrates the power supply circuit to realize low power battery power supply. In order to facilitate users, WisBlock Base has reserved USB ports, indicator lights, keys, and extended IO interfaces.

RAK11200 is the WisBlock Core board which consists of ESP32 WROVER. It supports WiFi and BLE functions, and supply a rich resource MCU so that you can program it if you want.

WisBlock is not only a functional test capable product in the product development verification stage, but it is also uitable for industrial products oriented to mass production. It uses a high-speed connector to ensure the integrity of the signal. At the same time, it is equipped with a fastening screw, which can be used in a vibration environment. And WisBlock can be used reliably in various civil and industrial scenarios through rigorous reliability tests.

WisBlock uses a compact stacked hardware design, which integrates various computing, connecting, and sensor circuits in the size of 60*30 mm. The compact size makes it easy for users to build in various customized housings to achieve complete products. RAK also has a series of housings for WisBlock modules, which can meet the requirements of various protection levels.

## Safety Information

Read the following items carefully so that WisBlock can be used safely.

### Hardware

- Use WisBlock according to its hardware specification, including the power supply, the temperature of use, the battery, and so on.
- Don't submerge WisBlock in liquids, and don't place WisBlock where water can reach.
- Don't power WisBlock using power sources that RAK hasn't suggested.
- Some WisBlock modules require higher current that can't be provided by USB port alone. In this case, it is recommended to connect a [battery](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5005-O/Datasheet/#battery-connector) to the WisBlock Base Board.

- There is already a bootloader in every WisBlock core board MCU when you receive the device, so that you needn't to flash the bootloader again. Normally, you only need to use it directly or upload new code into it through Arduino IDE. If you accidentally erase the bootloader, contact [RAK forum](forum.rakwireless.com).

- Don't unplug any hardware connector when you are uploading code into it, otherwise WisBlock may become unresponsive.

## Hardware Setup

The RAK5005-O board offers several GPIOs on solder pads or the WisBlock sensor or WisBlock IO modules. These GPIOs are named IO1 to IO6 and SW1. These GPIOs are connected to GPIOs of the RAK11200 module.

The GPIO assignments are defined in the RAK11200 variant.h file of the Arduino BSP.

### Library Management on Arduino

In the Arduino IDE, the Library Manager and the libraries installed are available for every Arduino sketch.

### Reserved GPIO Pins

It is not recommended to use the reserved GPIO pins. Some GPIOs cannot be used freely, as they are already assigned to module peripherals or have special functions during booting.

#### Bootstraping Pins

- `GPIO0` pin is used as a bootstrapping pin and should be low to enter UART download mode. Make sure it is not pulled low by a peripheral device during boot or the firmware will not start.

- `GPIO2` pin is used as a bootstrapping pin, and should be low to enter UART download mode. Make sure it is not pulled high by a peripheral device during boot or you will not be able to flash a firmware to the module.

- `GPIO12` is used as a bootstrapping pin to select the output voltage of an internal regulator which powers the flash chip (`VDD_SDIO`). This pin has an internal pulldown so if left unconnected it will read low at reset (selecting default 3.3 V operation). Make sure it is not pulled high by a peripheral device during boot or the module might not be able to start.

- `GPIO15` can be used to stop debug output on Serial during boot. If pulled low, there will be no output on the Serial port during the boot process. This can be helpful in battery-powered applications where you do not want to use the Serial port at all to reduce power consumption.

#### SPI Flash Integrated Pins

`GPIO06` to `GPIO11` are connected to the integrated SPI flash on the ESP32-WROVER chip and are not recommended for other uses.

#### Input Only Pins

`GPIO34-39` can only be set as input mode and do not have software pullup or pulldown functions.

#### PSRAM Pins

`GPIO16` and `GPIO17` are used for the RAK11200 Pseudo static RAM (PSRAM).

## ESP32 Basic Over The Air (OTA)

OTA stands for Over-The-Air. This feature allows uploading a new program to RAK11200 using WiFi instead of requiring the user to connect the RAK11200 to a computer via USB to perform the update. See the detailed instructions on the link below.

 - [ESP32 Basic OTA in Arduino IDE](https://lastminuteengineers.com/esp32-ota-updates-arduino-ide/)

If you already installed the RAKwireless ESP32, then the BasicOTA sketch has also been installed.

1. Open the Arduino IDE -> File -> Examples-> ArduinoOTA-> BasicOTA.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak11200/quickstart/arduino-ota-sketch.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Arduino OTA Sketch"
/>

2. Modify the following two variables with your network credentials, so that RAK11200 can establish a WiFi connection with the existing network. Then save and upload the BasicOTA sketch.

```cpp
const char* ssid = "..........";
const char* password = "..........";
```

3. Now, upload a new sketch using over the air port.

4. Copy the blink LED sketch below to your Arduino IDE.

```cpp
unsigned long previousMillis = 0;  // will store last time LED was updated
const long interval = 1000;  // interval at which to blink (milliseconds)
int ledState = LOW;  // ledState used to set the LED

void setup() {
  pinMode(WB_LED1, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // loop to blink without delay
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
  if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval) {
    // save the last time you blinked the LED
    previousMillis = currentMillis;
    // if the LED is off turn it on and vice-versa:
    ledState = not(ledState);
    // set the LED with the ledState of the variable:
    digitalWrite(WB_LED1,  ledState);
  }
}
```

The `delay()` for blinking built-in LEDs is not used because RAK11200 ESP32-WROVER pauses your program during the `delay()` routine. If the next OTA request is generated while the program is paused waiting for the `delay()` to pass, the OTA request will be lost.

5. Open Arduino IDE and select Tools->Port->esp32-xxxx, as shown in Figure 13.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisblock/rak11200/quickstart/arduino-ota-port.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Arduino OTA WiFi Port"
/>

6. Finally, click on Upload button.

Within a few seconds, the new sketch will be uploaded using over the air port.

## ESP32 Deep Sleep

To achieve maximum power saving during deep sleep, it is necessary to switch off Bluetooth and WiFi before calling esp_deep_sleep_start().

```cpp
#include <esp_wifi.h>
#include <esp_bt.h>
...
  esp_wifi_stop();
  esp_bt_controller_disable();
  esp_deep_sleep_start();
```

### Add WisBlock Core RAK11200 to the Platform
1. Clone [WisBlock repository](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock).
```
git clone https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock.git
```

2. Copy the file **wiscore_rak11200.json** located on folder **<cloned_dir>\WisBlock\PlatformIO\RAK11200** to espressif32 platform folder.

- The platform folder path is similar to the following:

  - Windows: **%userprofile%\.platformio\platforms\espressif32\boards**
  - Linux (Ubuntu): **$HOME/.platformio/platforms/espressif32/boards**
  - Mac OS: **/Users/{Your_User_id}/.platformio/platforms/espressif32/boards**

### Add WisBlock Core RAK11200 to the Framework

Copy the folder **WisCore_RAK11200_Board** located on **<cloned_dir>\WisBlock\PlatformIO\RAK11200** to the variants folder inside the espressif32 package folder.

- The espressif32 package folder path is similar to the following:

  - Windows: **%userprofile%\.platformio\packages\framework-arduinoespressif32\variants**
  - Linux (Ubuntu):  **$HOME/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoespressif32/variants**
  - Mac OS: **/Users/{Your_User_id}/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoespressif32**

### Library Management on PlatformIO

The PlatformIO libraries are managed on a per-project basis. You install a library for a specific project and not for the entire IDE. Thus it is possible to have the same library working with different versions in two different projects.
