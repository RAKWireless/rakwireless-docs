# RAK1904 WisBlock 3-axis Acceleration Sensor Datasheet

## Overview
### Description

The RAK1904 WisBlock 3-axis Acceleration Sensor, part of the RAK Wireless Wisblock series, is an ultra-low-power high-performance three-axis linear accelerometer with a digital I2C interface. The device features ultra-low-power operational modes that allow advanced power saving and smart embedded functions.
The accelerometer of the RAK1904 module can be dynamically configured to work in the scales of ¬±2g/¬±4g/¬±8g/¬±16g, and is capable of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 1 Hz to 5.3 kHz.

### Features 
* **User selectable scales**: ¬±2g/¬±4g/¬±8g/¬±16g
* **Data acquisition rates**: from 1 Hz to 5.3 kHz 
* **Module size**: 10 x 10 mm

#### Pin Definition
The RAK1904 WisBlock 3-axis Acceleration Sensor comprises a standard WisIO connector. This WisIO connector allows the RAK1904 module to be mounted on a WisBlock baseboard, such as, RAK5005-O. The pin order of the connector  and the definition of the pinout are shown in Figure 2. Note, only the I2C related pins, interrupt pins, VDD, and GND are connected to this module.
