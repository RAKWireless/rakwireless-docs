## Product Description

**RAK1920** is a **WisBlock IO** module which extends the **WisBlock** system with an adapter board to connect Click Boards (MikroElektronika), QWICC (Sparkfun) based and Grove (Seeed) based sensors to **WisBlock**. 


<!--
The RAK1920 module is part of the WisBlock series, specifically, it is one of the modules that belongs to the WisIO category. This module was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way, and must be combined with a WisCore and a WisBase module.

The RAK1920 module is a sensor extension module, it supports several defacto-standard interfaces in the IoT market and allows customers to integrate sensors manufactured by Mikroe, SparkFun, SeeedStudio, and others. For example, the RAK1920 supports the Click Boards‚Ñ¢ series of module provided by Mikroe, Qwiic Connect‚Ñ¢ sensor interface designed by SparkFun, and it supports all kinds of I¬≤C module digital I/O, UART and ADC sensors with a Grove‚Ñ¢ interface.
