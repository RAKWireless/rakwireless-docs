## Overview

### Description

The RAK2305 module, part of the WisBlock IO series, was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way and must be combined with a WisBlock Core and a Base module.

The RAK2305 module is a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in a single module. The core of the module is an ESP32-WROVER-B, which features a PCB antenna. This module is designed to be part of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. It can function as a master or a slave in a Bluetooth network. Internally it supports SPI/I2C/UART interfaces.


### Features

-  Wi-Fi + BLE module for Internet-of-Things
-  I/O ports: UART/I2C/SPI/GPIO
- 4MB SPI flash and 8MB PSRAM
- Ultra-Low-Power Consumption
- Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n
- Module size: 29.5 x 25mm

:::tip üìù NOTE
1.	VBAT is battery output voltage, the max voltage is 4.2V
2.	When IO0 is pulled-down, enter UART download mode, when is pulled-up, enter flash operation mode. Default, the IO0 is pull-up.

### Hardware 

The hardware specification is categorized into four parts. It discuses the interfacing of the module and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK2305 WisBlock WiFi Interface Module.


#### Interfaces


##### UART Interface

The RAK2305 module provides two UART interfaces: UART0 and UART1.  The UART0 can be used for upgrading firmware or to access console output through WisBlock baseboard USB interface. The UART1 is the main communication interface with WisBlock Core module.

##### SPI Interface

The RAK2305 supports one single SPI Interface. It can be operated either in the master or slave mode, both can be implemented in full-duplex or half-duplex communication modes. The SPI interface supports the following features:
- Four SPI transfer modes, which is defined by the polarity (CPOL) and the phase (CPHA) of the SPI clock.
- An internal FIFO buffer of 64-byte.

##### I2C Interface

The RAK235 module provides an I2C bus interface. Depending on the user‚Äôs configuration, it can serve as an I2C master or slave. The I2C interface supports:
- Standard mode (100 Kbit/s) and Fast mode (400 Kbit/s).
- Up to 5MHz, constrained by the SDA pull-up strength.
- 7-bit/10-bit addressing mode.
The RAK2305 module allows users to access directly to the registers to control I2C interfaces, which add more flexibility in the design of the final solution.


##### Download Interface

The RAK2305 module uses the UART0 interface to download customized application code into the ESP32‚Äôs flash memory. The users can use a USB to UART cable for this purpose. Alternatively, once the RAK2305 is mounted on top of RAK5005-O baseboard, such as the RAK5005, then users can access the UART0 interface through the RAK5005‚Äôs USB interface instead. The pinout if the USB port of the RAK2305 is shown in Figure 4.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Before download, you need to pull down IO0.

##### Core Module

The core components inside of the RAK2305 module is the ESP32-WROVER-B, which comes with a PCB antenna. The module is designed to work with 3.3V supplied by the baseboard. In order to prevent any instability on EN (Enable pin), a RC delay circuit is added to this pin, and the EN pin is pulled up to 3.3V by default. Figure 10 shows the section of the schematic that involves the ESP32-WROVER-B component.
