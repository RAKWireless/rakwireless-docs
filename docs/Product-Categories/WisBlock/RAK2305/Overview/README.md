## Product Description

**RAK2305** is a **WisBlock IO** module which extends the **WisBlock** system with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. It is based on the Espressif ESP32 Wrover module. It communicates with the **WisBlock Core** module over an UART interface using the Espressif AT commands.

<!--
The RAK2305 module is part of the WisBlock series, specifically, it is one of the modules that belongs to the WisIO category. This module was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way, and must be combined with a WisCore and a WisBase module.

The RAK2305 module is a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in a single module. The core of the module is an ESP32-WROVER-B, which features a PCB antenna. This module is designed to be part of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. It can function as a master or a slave in a Bluetooth network. Internally it supports SPI/I2C/UART interfaces.
