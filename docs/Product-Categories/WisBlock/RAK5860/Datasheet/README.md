## Overview

### Description

The RAK5860 WisBlock IO module, was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way and must be combined with a WisBlock Core and a Base module.

The RAK5860 is a module designed to work with the RAK5005-O baseboard, it provides wireless communication (LTE Cat M1, LTE Cat NB2) to the final application. This module supports LTE-FDD network and supports half-duplex operation in the LTE network. It also provides optional GNSS functionality.

For debugging purposes, a Micro-USB connector is used for sending AT commands, data transmission, and receiving GNSS NMEA output. Once the module is integrated with the RAK5005-O baseboard, the internal UART port of the module is connected through the IO connector to a WisBlock Core module. 

### Features 

*	Quectel BG77 with LTE Cat M1, LTE cat NB2 and GNSS
*	IPEX connectors for the LTE and GPS antenna
*	Micro-USB connector.
*	Nano SIM and ESIM options
*	Status Indication LEDs.
*	Power Supply: 2.6-4.2V, typical supply voltage 3.3V
*	Module size: 25mm x 35 mm

#### Schematic Diagram
The following sections will describe the schematic of the RAK5860 module, which include: 

*	Turn on/off module
*	IO Connector
*	Voltage-level translator
*	SIM card circuit
*	USB Connector
*	Status Indication LEDs
*	Main Antenna
*	GNSS Antenna

##### Turn on/off mechanism

Figure 6 shows a circuit to allow turn on or to turn off the module. By default, the internal Quectel BG77 module is in power off mode, it can be turned on by driving WIS_PWRKEY to high state (positive digital pulse) for a period of 500-1000ms. 

Driving WIS_PWRKEY high for 650-1500ms, the module will execute power-down procedure after WIS_PWRKEY is released, then enter off mode.  

Alternatively, the user can send a command **AT+QPOWD** command turn off the internal Quectel BG77 module.

The RAK5860 only uses a subset of all the pins available in the IO connector. These are shown in the Table below:

| **Name** | **Description** | **Comment** | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| VBAT | BG77 Power Supply | Max 4.2V | 
| 3v3_S | 3.3V for GNSS Antenna |  | 
| 3V3 | 3.3V For Voltage Level Transistor |  | 
| WIS_PWRKEY | Turn on/off BG77 | Active High | 
| WIS_TX | UART TXD | BG77 MAIN_RX, 1.8V power domain | 
| WIS_RX | UART RXD | BG77 MAIN_TX, 1.8V power domain | 


##### IO Connector Pin order

Figure 8 shows the IO connector‚Äôs pin order. The connector is located in the
bottom layer of the RAK5860 module.

##### Voltage-level translator

Within the BG77, all interfaces are designed to work with 1.8V level. RAK5860 features a voltage-level translator in order to down-convert the 3.3V coming from the WisBlock Core module. The Figure 9 shows the design of the internal voltage-level translator.

* When WIS_TX is high (3.3V), the NPN triode is turned off, BG77_RX is pulled high (1.8V)

* When WISTX is low (0V), the NPN triode is turned on, BG77 RX is low (0V).

* When BG77_TX is low (0V), the NPN triode is turned on, WIS_RX is low (0V)

* When BG77TX is high (1.8V), the NPN triode is turned off, WIS RX is pulled high (3.3V)

:::tip üìù NOTE:
VDD_EXT is 1.8V, from BG77 internal regulator, BG77 pin 21

##### SIM card circuit

The RAK5860 module only supports the 1.8V ESIM/SIM card, the following Figure 12 shows SIM interface circuit. by default, we use Nano SIM card, eSIM is no mounting. In order to offer good ESD protection, a TVS diode array is added in the SIM card circuitry

##### USB Connector

The RAK5860 module provides a Micro-USB connector for connection with a host device. The USB data lines USB+ and USB- are connected directly to the BG77. The VBUS line can be used for USB connection detection. 

In order to offer good ESD protection, a TVS diode array is added in the USB connector circuit.
