## Product Description

**RAK5802** is a **WisBlock IO** module which extends the **WisBlock** system with an industry standard RS485 to serial converter. It supports one RS485 port and voltage supply for connected sensors.    

The **RAK580**2 module features one RS485 interface. A protection circuity is added against ESD hazard. It complies with the IEC61000-4-2 standard and can protect up to 18 KV HBM ESD.    

In addition, the **RAK5802** supports one I2C interface to connect external sensors.

<!--
The RAK5802 module is part of the WisBlock series, specifically, it is one of the modules that belongs to the WisIO category. This module was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way, and must be combined with a WisCore and a WisBase module.

The RAK5802 is a RS485 ModBus extension module that allows users to provide IoT connectivity to a new/existing solution with RS485 interface. This module converts the RS485 signals into UART signals. These signals are collected by a MCU located inside of a WisCore module for further data transmission. 

The RAK5802 module features one RS485 interface. Inside, a protection circuity is added to protect against ESD hazard. The RAK5802 module complies with the IEC61000-4-2 standard and can protect up to 18 KV HBM ESD.

In addition, the RAK5802 supports one I2C interface, customer can use this I2C interface to connect external sensors.
