# WisBlock

<rk-head img="/assets/rakwireless/product-categories/WisBlock.svg" center>

WisBlock is an amazing product built by the RAK company for the IoT industry. With its modular approach solutions are built like clicking blocks together to realize your ideas.
Its modular approach makes it easy to implement low power wide area network (LPWAN) into your IoT solution.
Using industry grade connectors WisBlock is not only applicable for rapid prototyping, development of solutions, but the same hardware can be used in the final product and mass production.
In a small size of just 30 x 60mm WisBlock combines a MCU, LoRa© communication, up to 4 on-board sensors and IO or communication extensions.
WisBlock solutions can be coded with the easy to use entry level Arduino™ IDE or PlatformIO extension for Atom or MSVC. The Arduino™ framework offers a wide range of libraries that are ready to use. For larger projects WisBlock solutions can be created as well with professional IDE’s like the Segger Embedded Studio or Keil.
WisBlock consists of WisBase, WisCore, WisSensor and WisIO modules.

## WisBlock Base

<rk-head img="/assets/rakwireless/product-categories/WisBlock-Base.svg">

WisBlock is build up on a WisBase, a platform carrier that allows easy plug-in of 1 WisCore processing board, 1 WisIO interface board and up to 4 WisSensor boards. WisBase is providing the power supply, battery and solar panel supplies and charging block. In addition, it has connectors for programming and debugging.

<!-- During development phase WisBase allows you to quickly switch between microcontrollers, IO functionality and sensors by simply changing the modules. Repairs and upgrades are easy with WisBase on your final product because modules can be changed with just plug'n'play. For controlling and limiting power consumption of your IoT solution, WisBase enables to control the power supply for the WisSensor and WisIO modules, limiting the power consumption by switching off these modules if they are not needed. -->

## WisBlock Core

<rk-head img="/assets/rakwireless/product-categories/WisBlock-Core.svg">

WisCore is the processing unit of your IoT solution. Select the processing power based on the requirements of your application from a range of processing boards which starts with low single core to high dual core processing power units are available.

## WisBlock Sensor

<rk-head img="/assets/rakwireless/product-categories/WisBlock-Sensor.svg">

WisSensor offers a range of sensors for sensing environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, …), location and movement conditions (GNSS location, accelerometer, …) that you just plug into WisBase makes it easy to complete your application with the required sensors.

<!-- WisSensor modules are with 10 x 10mm size small sensor breakout boards. Only the GNSS module is larger with 10 x 22mm and occupies 2 sensor slots on the base board

## WisBlock IO

<rk-head img="/assets/rakwireless/product-categories/WisBlock-IO.svg">

WisIO extensions provide your application with interfaces and communication extensions that are not covered by WisCore or WisSensor blocks. This includes : IO connectors to add user interfaces like keyboards, buttons and displays, adapter for third party sensor boards from Seeed Grove, Sparkfun QWICC and MikroElektronika Click! Boards, sensor interfaces , communication modules , alternative power supplies.
