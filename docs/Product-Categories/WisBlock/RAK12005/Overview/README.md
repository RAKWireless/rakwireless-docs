## Product Description

The RAK12005, a part of WisBlock Sensor, is an electroconductive-liquid detect module used for detecting water and other electroconductive liquids. If the detection area is wet, the output of Microchip's MCP606 CMOS op-amp will go positive, signaling the presence of liquid.

RAK12005 WisBlock Rain Sensor Module also has a separate sensor PCB, the RAK12030. This sensor PCB is connected to the RAK12005 with a cable so that you can place the sensor under the open sky and keep your WisBlock solution in a dry place or inside a waterproof enclosure.

## Product Features

* **Sensor specifications**
    * 3.3&nbsp;V Power supply (disconnect option to save power)
    * Chipset: Microchip MCP606
    * Digital output
    * Configurable detection threshold via trimmer
    * Separate sensor PCB RAK12030, size 25 x 35&nbsp;mm

* **Size**
    * 15 x 25&nbsp;mm

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK12005**, you need at least a **RAK12030 Rain Sensing Pad** and a **WisBlock Base** to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** provides power supply to the **RAK12005** module. Furthermore, you need a **WisBlock Core** module to use the sensor.
