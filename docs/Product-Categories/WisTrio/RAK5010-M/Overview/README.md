## Product Description

The **RAK5010-M WisTrio NB-IoT Tracker** is an advanced, highly flexible eMTC/NB-IoT/EGPRS tracker based on Quectel BG96 LTE Cat M1&NB1, integrated with GPS, BLE, and a variety of sensors. The MCU running the board is a Nordic nRF52840 controller.

With the GPS and BLE features, the device can be used in a wide range of applications from outdoor to indoor scenarios where location-based services are necessary.

The board is equipped with two sensors on board: humidity and temperature sensor and 3-axis motion sensor. Additionally, the extension IOs in the module allow expandable sensor application in addition to the on-board ones.

This board is particularly suitable to be used as a quick testing and prototyping tool for applications requiring Nb-IoT connectivity. Application development supports the GCC environment.
