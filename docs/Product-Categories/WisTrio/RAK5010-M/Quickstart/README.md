### Configure the RAK5010-M

#### Through the UART Interface

After connecting to the RAK5010-M through the UART Interface as shown in section 2, the first action is to verify the version of the firmware. This can be achieved with the following command, as shown in Figure 7.

```
at+version
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/3.configuring-rak5010-m/configure-at-command.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK Serial Port Tool, get firmware version"
/>

* Similarly, you can send other AT commands of RAK5010-M shown in the **[RAK5010-M AT Commands](#rak5010-m-at-commands)** section.


### Connecting to Cellular Network

In this section, a procedure to configure RAK5010-M to a Cellular network is presented. For demonstration, a China Mobile SIM card and based on GSM network were used. There are two methods to connect and send packets over the Cellular network: Manual and Automatic mode. 

To establish a connection to a Cellular network, the following element are necessary:

- Mobile operator‚Äôs MCC and MNC
- Mobile operator‚Äôs APN parameter and password (optional)
- Remote server IP and port number. 

#### Manual Connection Mode

1. Scan the available cellular network providers. Send the following AT command.

```sh
at+scan=cellular
```

* After waiting around 30 seconds, an output similar to the Figure 8 appears. In this case, two providers were detected: CHINA MOBILE and CHN-UNICOM. In your local area, you should different results.

  width="40%"
  caption="RAK Serial Port Tool, scan the available cellular network"
/>


2. Connect to the SIM card‚Äôs operator.

Once the Cellular network operator is identified, send the following AT command to choose the Cellular carrier compatible with the SIM card in use. As shown in Figure 9, in this example, the SIM card belongs to Hologram.io, which has worldwide coverage carrier. This time the carrier ENTEL is chosen which the following command.  

```sh
at+set_config=cellular:(AT+COPS=0,0,"ENTEL")
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/4.connecting-cellular-network/3.cellular-operator.jpg"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK Serial Port Tool, choose to the Cellular operator"
/>

* Then, the following command is sent in order to confirm the registration was successful, as shown in Figure 10.

```sh
at+set_config=cellular:(AT+COPS?)
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/4.connecting-cellular-network/3.1.cellular-operator-confirmation.jpg"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK Serial Port Tool, confirm the registration to the preferable carrier"
/>

3. Configure the APN

The next step is to configure the APN, username, and password that will be required by the Cellular carrier in order to establish a connection. In this case:

  -	**APN**: imovil.entelpcs.cl
  -	**username**: entelpcs
  -	**password**: entelpcs

The final parameter ‚Äú1‚Äù refers to the authentication mode (PAP). The following command is sent, as shown in Figure 11. 

```sh
at+set_config=cellular:(AT+QICSGP=1,1,"imovil.entelpcs.cl","entelpcs","entelpcs", 1)
```
<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/4.connecting-cellular-network/4.register-cellular-operator.jpg"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK Serial Port Tool, register to the Cellular operator"
/>

4. Enable the GPRS interface 

Once the APN is configured, the PDP context must be activated, in order to use the GPRS interface. The following AT command is sent, as shown in the Figure 12.

```sh
at+set_config=cellular:(AT+QIACT=1)
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/4.connecting-cellular-network/5.gprs-interface.jpg"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK Serial Port Tool, enable the GPRS interface."
/>


5. Set the IP address of the remote server

Then, set the IP address of the server which will receive the packet sending from RAK5010-M. In the example, the remote server has the IP address of **209.172.33.72**, and there is a process listening at the port **12111**. 

```sh
at+set_config=cellular:209.172.33.72:12111:ENTEL:ENTEL:imovil.entelpcs.cl:0
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/4.connecting-cellular-network/6.configure-remote-server-ip.jpg"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK Serial Port Tool, configure the remote server's IP."
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:
This IP address is just used for example, and it is my testing server actually. For your configuration, use your own server IP address.
:::

6. Sending data 

Finally, The RAK5010-M is configured properly, and it‚Äôs ready for sending data over the Cellular network. In this case, some random characters are sent: ‚Äú123456‚Äù. The following AT command is sent, as shown in the Figure 14.

```sh
at+send=cellular:123456
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/4.connecting-cellular-network/7.send-data-to-remote-server.jpg"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK Serial Port Tool, sending data to remote server."
/>



7. Receiving data

A TCP/IP process must be listening on the IP and port previously defined. The IP address must be a public IP number. Please also make sure the port used is not blocked by a firewall. The Figure 15 shows that the list of characters sent in the previous step were properly received by the TCP/IP process.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/4.connecting-cellular-network/8.receive-data.jpg"
  width="75%"
  caption="Verify the data received by the server"
/>


As you see in the **Figure 15**, the server has received the packet successfully, and the data sent is ‚Äú**123456**‚Äù which is same with the one we just sent out.

#### Automatic Connection Mode

The procedure of the automatic connection mode is very similar to the manual mode, except for the step 6, in which the transmission interval and the periodic data transmission parameters are set. 

1. Scan the available cellular network providers. Send the following AT command.

    - Same as the manual mode

2. Connect to the SIM card‚Äôs operator. 

    - Same as the manual mode

3. Configure the APN

    - Same as the manual mode

4. Enable the GPRS interface

    - Same as the manual mode

5. Set the IP address of the remote server 

    - Same as the manual mode

6. Set data transmission interval

In order to activate the automatic data transmission, the following AT command must be sent. As shown in the Figure 16, an interval of 180000 milliseconds (3 minutes) was configured. The ‚Äú1‚Äù before the interval indicates the periodic data sending loop is activated.

```sh
at+set_config=cellular:send_interval:1:180000
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/4.connecting-cellular-network/9.set-transmission-interval.jpg"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK Serial Port Tool, set the data transmission interval"
/>

As you see, this setting means that we open the sending loop and the interval time at 180 seconds. To know more details about the command, refer to the **[RAK5010-M AT Commands](#rak5010-m-at-commands)**.

7. Restart the module

To apply the new configuration, the module must be restarted. Send the following AT command as shown in the Figure 17.

```sh
at+set_config=device:restart
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/4.connecting-cellular-network/10.restart-the-module.jpg"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK Serial Port Tool, restart the module."
/>



8. Receiving the data. 

After restarting, RAK5010-M will connect automatically to the Cellular network with the parameters configured previously. The RAK5010-M will sleep during the interval and wake up, activate the accelerometer, and the GPS, format the packet and send the data to the destination. Process logs will be displayed in the console as shown in the Figure 18.
