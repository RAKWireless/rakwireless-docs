### Upgrading the Firmware

Device Firmware Upgrade or DFU is a tool in upgrading your firmware. It is part of the [GitHub Open Source](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK813-BreakBoard) project you downloaded for upgrading the firmware of your IAR and Keil Compiler. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak815/quickstart/7upgrading-the-firmware/dfu-file-location.jpg"
  width="80%"
  caption="DFU File Location"
/>

* We provide users with hex files, which users can find in the open source project Doc folder:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak815/quickstart/7upgrading-the-firmware/dfu-hex-files.jpg"
  width="80%"
  caption="DFU Hex Files"
/>

* However, it should be noted that using the DFU function of the nRF, unlike the previous firmware programming method, the bootloader firmware must be programmed. Therefore, three firmwares need to be programmed to use the DFU function. They are the Bluetooth protocol stack firmware, the DFU application firmware, and the bootload firmware. Bootload firmware can be found in open source functions.

:::tip üìù NOTE
For details on how to program the Bluetooth protocol stack and application firmware, review the [Device Firmware Setup](#device-firmware-setup).
:::

* The following figure shows how to program bootloader firmware:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak815/quickstart/7upgrading-the-firmware/programming-bootloader.jpg"
  width="100%"
  caption="Programming Bootloader Firmware"
/>

* After all firmware are written, the device will automatically restart. At this time, use your
mobile phone Bluetooth scan, you will see a device named "**RAK813_DFU**".

  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak815/quickstart/7upgrading-the-firmware/rak813-ble-radio.jpg"
  width="35%"
  caption="RAK813 DFU Bluetooth Radio"
/>

* Use the nRF official phone app nRF Connect to connect to the device's Bluetooth. 

* To upgrade the firmware, you need to import the upgraded firmware to your mobile phone. The upgrade file, a zip file, is accessible from the downloaded open source code by following this directory: **RAK813-BreakBoard-master**>> **Doc**>> **Hex**>> **rak815_app_package.zip**. Copy this sample upgrade file to your mobile phone.
