## Product Description

The **RAK5010 WisTrio NB-IoT Tracker Pro** is an advanced, highly flexible eMTC/NB-IoT/EGPRS tracker based on Quectel BG96 LTE Cat M1 & NB1, integrated with GPS, BLE, and a variety of sensors. The MCU running the board is a Nordic nRF52840 microcontroller.

With the GPS and BLE features, the device can be used in a wide range of applications from outdoor to indoor scenarios where location-based services are necessary.

The board is equipped with four sensors onboard: humidity and temperature sensor, pressure sensor, 3-axis motion sensor, and ambient light sensor. Additionally, the extension IOs in the module allow expandable sensor applications in addition to the onboard ones.

This board is particularly suitable to be used as a quick testing and prototyping tool for applications requiring Nb-IoT connectivity. Application development supports the GCC environment.
