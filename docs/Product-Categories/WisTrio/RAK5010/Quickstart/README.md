### Connecting Cellular Network and Sending Packet over Cellular

In this section, you will learn more on how to connect Cellular Network of your device. 

- To start with,  insert a SIM card into your RAK5010. For this section, use China Mobile SIM card and based on GSM network for example.

As describe in the previous section, we learned that there are three ways to configure our RAK5010: through UART, BLE and microUSB. For this section,  I‚Äôll use UART to configure RAK5010 as an example, but surely you can use BLE or microUSB to configure it too.

OK! Let‚Äôs start configuring our RAK5010 through UART.

There are two ways to
connect Cellular network and send packet over Cellular: Manual and Automatic.

#### 1 . Connecting Cellular Network and Sending Packet over Cellular Manually

- To begin with, send the AT command `at+scan=cellular` to scan Cellular networks:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/ldd1gtipgjw2rdimcm06.jpg"
  width="45%"
  caption="Scanning for Cellular Networks"
/>  

- Wait for about 30 seconds, then you will see the following output in the serial port tool:


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/o1yixmjvgqaheaczyyvb.jpg"
  width="45%"
  caption="Scanned Cellular Network shown in Serial Port"
/> 

- As you see, RAK5010 has scanned around Cellular network and show them in the serial port tool.

Then, use the AT command `at+set_config=cellular: (AT+COPS=1,0,"CHINA MOBILE",0)` to configure the operator information:


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/s397ccuztyjg01v9oe57.jpg"
  width="45%"
  caption="Configuring the Operator"
/> 


Now, continue to configure by using the AT command `at+set_config=cellular: (AT+QICSGP=1,1,"CMCC","","",1)` and `at+set_config=cellular:(AT+QIACT=1)` :

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/viol2m3ggyntrqdrju3l.jpg"
  width="45%"
  caption="Configuring the Cellular Network"
/> 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/kbfkkzhigynpqvvserph.jpg"
  width="45%"
  caption="Configuring the Cellular Network"
/> 

- Then, set the IP address of the server which will receive the packet sending from RAK5010:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/wfgibirfba6br8wfddeo.jpg"
  width="45%"
  caption="Configuring the IP Address of the Server"
/> 

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 This IP address is just used for example, and it is my testing server actually. For your configuration, use your own server IP address.
:::

- OK, we‚Äôve configured RAK5010 correctly.

Next, let‚Äôs try sending a packet manually over Cellular.

- You can use the AT command `at+send=cellular:XXX` to send data over Cellular:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/qliw07b9ag9om2ytbi6k.jpg"
  width="45%"
  caption="Sending Data over Cellular"
/> 

- As you can see, the data we send is ‚Äú**123456**‚Äù. 

Now, let‚Äôs check it on our receiving server:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/muvnk5vma57gwns6apo9.jpg"
  width="75%"
  caption="Received Data shown in the terminal"
/>

Great! As you see in the **Figure 32**, the server has received the packet successfully, and the data sent is ‚Äú**123456**‚Äù which is same with the one we just sent out.

#### 2 . Connect Cellular Network and Send Packet Automatically

We have already discussed the manual process, now, we'll learn about the **automatic** way of connecting and sending data with Cellular Network. First, configure the parameters for the Cellular operator information and the receiving server information as follows (a China Mobile SIM card and based on GSM network were used as an example):

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/nmsor2nxqikesbzduzdj.jpg"
  width="45%"
  caption="Configuring the Cellular Network Parameters"
/>

- Then, set the interval for sending loop as follow:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/usvaf8prsuthawdgwv2t.jpg"
  width="45%"
  caption="Setting the Loop Intervals"
/>

As you see, this setting means that we open the sending loop and the interval time at 180 seconds. To know more details about the command, refer [here](/Product-Categories/WisTrio/RAK5010/Quickstart/#at-commands-for-rak5010-wistrio-nb-iot-tracker).

- Now, restart RAK5010 by sending the AT command `at+set_config=device:restart`:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/b5oewg5p13m9pvimgcr0.jpg"
  width="45%"
  caption="Restarting your RAK5010"
/>

After restarting, RAK5010 will connect the Cellular network which you just set and send packet of sensor‚Äôs data automatically in a loop. Every time it sends a packet out, RAK5010 will go to sleep for 180 seconds which you just set, then RAK5010 will wake up and searching GPS, building a new packet, and sending it out.

- You will see a continuously loop as the following picture shows:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/ijh8cftfzy4x9ybyalvr.jpg"
  width="45%"
  caption="Continuous Loop seen in The Serial Tool"
/>

- RAK5010 will send sensor‚Äôs data automatically in a loop.

Let‚Äôs check the data in the receiving server:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak5010/quickstart/5.connecting-cellular-network/urwjby1runkjaijb18re.jpg"
  width="100%"
  caption="Data Receive in the Server"
/>

Great! As we see, the server has received the packet which RAK5010 sends out successfully, and they are all sensor‚Äôs data in the packet.

## Miscellaneous

### Bluetooth Connection Modes

There are three BLE modes in RAK5010 from the firmware V3.0.0.6 on, the **Peripheral Mode**, the **Central Mode** and the **Beacon Scan Mode**. You can change the work mode of RAK5010‚Äôs BLE using this command provided in the [AT Commands for RAK5010 WisTrio NB-IoT Tracker Pro](/Product-Categories/WisTrio/RAK5010/Quickstart/#at-commands-for-rak5010-wistrio-nb-iot-tracker) section.

```sh
at+set_config=ble:work_mode:X:Y
```
**Description:** Set the work mode for BLE.
- **X** - 0: BLE peripheral mode, 1: BLE central mode. 2: Beacon scan mode.
- **Y** - 0: normal range, 1: BLE long range.

#### BLE Peripheral Mode

For the Peripheral Mode, you can scan RAK5010‚Äôs BLE and connect with it using your mobile device.

#### BLE Central Mode

For the Central Mode, RAK5010‚Äôs BLE will not broadcast so that your mobile devices will not be able to scan it.  This is very useful if you want to make the RAK5010 act as a BLE Gateway wherein BLE Sensor Nodes (up to 20 Devices) can send sensor data.

#### Beacon Scan Mode

For the Beacon Scan mode, RAK5010 can scan around the Beacon signal, it is useful for Beacon use case like iBeacon.

#### RAK5010 BLE Default Settings

By default, the RAK5010 LPWAN Evaluation Board will work on **Peripheral Mode.** In this mode users can configure it through BLE including DFU easily. It should be noted that after resetting the RAK5010, the user has only 60 seconds to establish a connection with your Mobile Device through BLE based on its power consumption settings. If no connection has been established within 60 seconds, the RAK5010's BLE signal will not be broadcasted and it will enter power saving mode. On the other hand, there is no limitation once you are already connected with the RAK5010's BLE.

If you set the RAK5010 to work in Central Mode, the RAK5010 will work first on Peripheral Mode for 30 seconds and if no connection is established after 30 seconds, it will automatically work in **Central Mode.** In this mode,the BLE signal of the RAK5010 will stop broadcasting and will not be visible on your mobile devices up until you change the work mode to peripheral mode or reset the RAK5010 again.

### Burning the Firmware

An easy and quick way to get started with your RAK5010 is through using a pre-compiled firmware.  However, if you wanted to compile your own customized firmware, you can visit [RUI Customized Development](/RUI/) documentation to learn how.
