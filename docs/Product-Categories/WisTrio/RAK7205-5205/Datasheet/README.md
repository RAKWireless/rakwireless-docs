##### LEDs

Three LEDs are used to indicate operating status, here are their functions:

- 🟢 **GREEN LED** : Status - Defined By User
- 🔵 **BLUE LED**: Status - Defined By User
- 🔴 **RED LED** : Charging Status - indicates the Li-ion Battery is Charging

##### Reset Push Button

Reset Push Button is used to reset the RAK811 module. To reset the module push the Reset Button for 1 second.

#### Pin Definition

Here are the six connectors for RAK5205 tracker board: **P1**, **P2**, **J11**, **J12**, **J22** and **J25**

##### P1

(Pin1 connected to VBATT, Pin2 connected to GND) Li-ion battery connector.

##### P2

(Pin1 connected to VBUS, Pin2 connected to GND) Solar cell interface.

##### J11

Pin1 is connected to VBUS. Pin2 is connected to VBIN. Without a battery
connection, the J11 needs to be short-circuited with a jumper. Instead, the J11
needs to be kept open.

##### J12
