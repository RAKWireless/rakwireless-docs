### What do you need?

1. **RAK612 WisNode Button**
2. Micro USB Cable
3. Gateway in Range for Testing
4. A Windows PC


:::tip üìù NOTE
This device released by RAKWireless is already pre-loaded with its latest firmware upon manufacture. If you want to have your device's firmware burned or upgraded, please refer to the section below:
* [Upgrading the Firmware](#upgrading-the-firmware)
:::

## Product Configuration

### Interfacing with RAK612 WisNode Button

In order for you to be able to interface with the RAK612 WisNode Button with your Windows Machine, you need to download the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip).

1. Using a standard **Micro - USB Cable**, connect your RAK612 WisNode Button to your computer.

:::tip üìù NOTE
If this is your first time to connect your RAK612 WisNode Button to your computer, it should automatically download the CH340 driver in order for them to communicate properly. Make sure to have an internet access if you want such automatic installation to be successful. If such process fails, re-plug your Micro - USB cord and proceed to the next step."
:::

2. Go to your **Device Manager** by pressing : **Windows + R** and type `devmgmt.msc` or **search in Start Menu** or right click "**My Computer**" or "**This PC**" and click **Manage**. Look for **Other Devices.**

<rk-img

  width="100%"
  caption="Missing Driver for the RAK612 WisNode Button"
/>

3. Under "**Other devices**" drop down list, an unknown **USB2.0-Serial** driver must appear. Right click into it and choose "**Search automaticaly for updated driver software**". Again, before doing so, make sure to have an internet access or it will fail.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak612/quickstart/interfacing-with-rak612/automatic-install.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Automatic Driver Installation via Internet"
/>

4. Wait for it to automatically download and install the missing driver. Once installation is done, "**USB-SERIAL CH340**" must appear in the **Ports (COM & LPT)** drop down list. Take note of the COM Port associated with the driver as it will be used in the succeeding steps. For this sample process, the COM Port used by the USB-SERIAL CH340 driver is **COM4**.

  width="100%"
  caption="USB-SERIAL CH340 Driver Successfully Installed"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE
In case the driver is still not installed upon doing the previous steps, kindly download the driver manually through this [link](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/RAK811/Tools/).
:::

5. Let us now test if your RAK612 WisNode Button can now communicate with the RAK Serial Port Tool. Connect with the RAK Serial Port Tool using the parameters listed below and click "**Open**".

   - **COM**: Choose the COMPort associated with the USB-SERIAL CH340 from the previous step. For this tutorial, the COM Port is COM4.
   - **Baud Rate**: **115200** bps

6. To verify connectivity, let's try sending AT+Commands. In the RAK Serial Port Tool, there are built-in AT+Commands within it at the right side. Try sending the code below to check the firmware version of your RAK612 WisNode Button. If connection is successful, in the monitor panel at the left, the firmware version should appear same with the image shown below:

```sh
at+version
```

Congratulations! :tada: You have just successfully interfaced your RAK612 WisNode Button with your computer!

### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

In this section, we will be connecting the RAK612 WisNode Button to The Things Network (TTN). If you don't have an account yet, head on to [https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create one. Once done, Log in to your account and go to the console which can be found here:

Here are the things that you should take note in adding an application:

1. **Application ID** - this will be the unique id of your application in the Network. Please note that characters should be in lower case, no spaces are allowed.
2. **Description** - this is a short and concise human readable description of your application.
3. **Application EUI** - this will be generated automatically by The Things Network for convenience.
4. **Handler Registration** - handler you want to register this application to.

- After you fill in the necessary information, press the "**Add application**" button at the bottom of this page. If you see the following page, this means that you have successfully registered your application.

### Key Functions Customizing

This section walks through the step-by-step discussion on how to customize each key functions of the RAK612 WisNode Button. For you to enable the message customization, you must at least have the 2.0.2.1.2 firmware version. 

:::tip üìù NOTE
If your RAK612 WisNode Button's firmware version is lower than the least version set, please download the latest [RAK612 WisNode Button Firmware](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/LoRa/RAK612-LoRaButton/Firmware/) and proceed to the [Upgrading the Firmware](#upgrading-the-firmware) section.
:::

#### Defaults

Listed below are the default messages send by the RAK612 WisNode Button whenever each key is pressed:

| Key   | Message |
| ----- | ------- |
| Key 1 | "Key 1" |
| Key 2 | "Key 2" |
| Key 3 | "Key 3" |
| Key 4 | "Key 4" |


#### Customizing

To fully customize the messages sent by the RAK612 WisNode Button in each key pressed, we must configure it using the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip) with the AT Command below:

```sh
at+key_config=<key>,<frame_port>,<message>
```

- **key** - The key you want to customize in your  RAK612 WisNode Button
- **frame_port** - the port you want to send the customized message
- **message** - your customized message in replacement of your default message in every key pressed.

1. **Connect** your RAK612 WisNode Button to your Windows PC using a Micro USB cable. Follow the steps in the [Interfacing with RAK612 WisNode Button](#interfacing-with-rak612-wisnode-button) section if this is the first time you are connecting the device into your WIndows PC. 

2. Using the same RAK Serial Port Tool used in the previous step and the AT Command syntax, let us try configuring your RAK612 WisNode Button keys. As an example, try sending the AT Command same with the image shown below:

```sh
at+key_config=2,37,Hello Mark Angelo!
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak612/quickstart/key-function-customizing/at-command.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="Configuring Each button"
/>

* You should be able to change the message to "**Hello Mark Angelo!**" whenever you press the key "**Key 2**". Congratulations, you have just customized your RAK612 WisNode Button keys. Go try the other keys with your desired message!
