### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

In this section, a practical exercise will be performed to show how to connect the RAK7200 module to The Thing Network (TTN‚Ñ¢) platform. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/connecting-to-ttn/7.ttn-context.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="RAK7200 in the context of the TTN"
/>


As shown in Figure 7, the RAK7200 module is one of the devices located on the left side. In the context of an IoT solution, the objective is to deploy devices to sense the relevant process variables and transmit the data to the backend servers located in the cloud. The data will be processed and integrated as part of a larger solution that, ultimately, could generate efficiency, traceability, predictability capacity among others.

The RAK7200 module can be part of this ecosystem, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple is to send data to the TTN using the LoRaWAN¬Æ protocol. To achieve this, the RAK7200 module must be located inside of the coverage of a LoRaWAN¬Æ gateway.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/connecting-to-ttn/11.adding-application.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Adding an Application"
/>

* Here are the things that you should take note in adding an application:

    * **Application ID** - this will be the unique ID of your application in the Network. Note that the characters should be in lower case, no spaces are allowed.
    * **Description** - this is a short and concise human readable description of your application.
    * **Application EUI** - this will be generated automatically by The Things Network for convenience.
    * **Handler Registration** - handler you want to register this application to.


3. After you fill in the necessary information, press the "**Add application**" button at the bottom of this page. If you see the same page as shown in Figure 12, this means that you have successfully registered your application.


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/connecting-to-ttn/12.application-overview.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Overview"

#### LoRaWAN¬Æ Join Mode

The LoRaWAN¬Æ specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN¬Æ network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). In OTAA, the previously personalized end-device is activated when is deployed or reset. On the other hand, in ABP, the personalization and activation are done as a single step. 


Hence, this is referred to as the ‚Äú**Join Mode**". LoRaWAN¬Æ allows the OTAA mode and the ABP mode. In this section, the configuration process of these two modes is explained, both on the platform side and the node side.


##### OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA Mode on the Platform


As shown in the Figure 15, the default activation mode in TTN is the OTAA mode. Therefore, no further actions are required in the platform side. 


To set up the RAK7200 module to join the TTN using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK7200 module to the Computer (see Figure 1) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication and verify the current configuration by sending either of these two AT commands:

```
at+get_config=lora:status
```

```
at+version
```

By default, the parameters configured in the RAK7200 modules are:

- LoRa¬Æ join mode: **OTTA**
- LoRa¬Æ class: **Class A**
- LoRa¬Æ region: **AU915** 
- Device EUI: **00605E75749FCD6D**
- Application EUI: **00605E75749FCD6D**
- Application Key: **4E2003296FC5CD26F46940A6DAFA9D1**

1. Set the LoRa¬Æ join mode to OTAA.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:0
```


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/ttn-otaa-mode/16.join-mode.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Setting LoRa¬Æ Join Mode to OTAA Mode"
/>


2. Set the LoRa¬Æ class to Class A.

```
at+set_config=lora:class:0
```


<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/ttn-otaa-mode/17.lora-class.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Setting LoRa¬Æ Class Parameter"
/>

3. Set the frequency/region to AU915.

* Refer in the [RAK7200 Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK7200/Datasheet/#rf-characteristics) for the list of supported frequencies.


```
at+set_config=lora:region:AU915
```

5. Set the Application EUI.

```
at+set_config=lora:app_eui:00605E75749FCD6D
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/ttn-otaa-mode/20.app-eui.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Setting LoRa¬Æ Application EUI Parameter"
/>


:::tip üìù NOTE:

The Device EUI parameter is not needed for the ChirpStack platform, therefore you will use the same ID as the Device EUI. Otherwise, the firmware will compliant. 

:::


6. Set the Application Key.

```
at+set_config=lora:app_key:4E2003296FC5CD26F46940A6DAFA9D1
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/ttn-otaa-mode/21.app-key.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Setting LoRa¬Æ Application Key Parameter"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:

After configuring all the parameters, you need to reset your RAK7200 Module for saving parameters.

:::


7. After resetting, join in OTAA mode.

```
at+join
```

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request was successfully received by a LoRa¬Æ gateway, then you should see the messages shown in Figure 22.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/ttn-otaa-mode/22.join-command.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Join into a LoRaWAN¬Æ Network"
/>

Once joined into the LoRaWAN¬Æ network, the RAK7200 firmware will start to send the data periodically. As shown in Figure 23, data will be saved in the TTN platform.

  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/ttn-otaa-mode/23.messaged-received.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="OTAA Test Sample Data Sent Viewed in TTN"
/>

##### ABP Mode

###### Configure the ABP mode on the Platform

If the ABP mode is preferred, then the TTN platform needs to be configured first. At TTN, once a device is created, you can select the ‚Äú**SETTINGS**‚Äù section of the ‚Äú**DEVICE**‚Äù and switch the ‚Äú**Activation Method**‚Äù.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/ttn-abp-mode/24.abp-mode.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="ABP Activation in TTN"
/>

* For ABP mode, the TTN parameters needed are the following:

  * **Device Address**
  * **Network Session Key**
  * **App Session Key**


  :::tip üìù NOTE:

These fields can be left empty in the form. TTN will automatically generate random values. In other cases, you can fill them with specific values.

:::

###### Configure the ABP mode on the RAK7200


To set up the RAK7200 module in joining the TNN using ABP, start by connecting the RAK7200 module to the Computer (see Figure 1) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool. Wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:


```
at+get_config=lora:status
```

```
at+version
```

As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK7200: 

- LoRa¬Æ join mode: **ABP**
- LoRa¬Æ class: **Class A**
- LoRa¬Æ region: **AU915** 
- Device address: **000781fb9**
- Network Session Key: **c280cb8d1df688bc18601a97025c588**
- Application Session Key: **4d42ec5caf97f03d833cdaf5003f69e1**


1. Set the LoRa¬Æ join mode to ABP.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:1
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

After configuring all parameters, you need to reset RAK7200 Module for saving parameters.

:::

7. After resetting, join in OTAA mode.

```
at+join
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

By using the ABP mode in LoRaWAN¬Æ, it doesn‚Äôt require to join a network before sending a LoRaWAN¬Æ package. But to keep the consistency of internal states of the firmware of the RAK7200 module, it is still required to send at+join command in the ABP mode. This time, the firmware should reply almost immediately with an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.

:::

  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/ttn-abp-mode/33.join-command.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Join into a LoRaWAN¬Æ Network"
/>


Once the RAK7200 joined into a LoRaWAN¬Æ network, it will start to send periodically the data collected from the GPS and other sensors. Then, go to the TTN Console to confirm that the messages ware properly received.


### Connecting with ChirpStack

In this section, a practical exercise will be performed to show how to connect the RAK7200 module to the ChirpStack platform.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/connecting-to-chirpstack/34.chirpstack-platform.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAK7200 module in the context of the ChirpStack platform"
/>

The ChirpStack or previously known as LoRaServer project provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN¬Æ networks. Like the case of TTN, the RAK7200 module is located in the periphery and transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa¬Æ gateway. Learn more about [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

:::tip üìù NOTE:

In this document, it is assumed that you are using a RAK LoRa¬Æ gateway, such as RAK7249. The gateway must be configured and registered previously to Chirpstack deployment. For further information, check the RAK documents for more details.

:::

You can provide your own Chirpstack deployment or use the one provided by RAK for testing purposes. RAK has enabled a set of LoRaServer on the cloud to support customers to test their RAK LoRa¬Æ gateway or RAK LoRa¬Æ node. Table below shows the IP address for the supported regions. Submit your request in the following URL to get an account and password.

  width="100%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Set Application Key"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Standard OTAA mode requires the **Device EUI**, **Application Key**, and the **Application EUI**. But in the ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only the Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and is not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, the Application EUI is a mandatory parameter in the RAK7200 module‚Äôs firmware. To resolve this mismatch, you can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration in the side of the node. 

:::


###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK7200

The RAK7200 module supports a series of AT commands to configure its internal parameters and control the functionalities of the module. 

To set up the RAK7200 module to join ChirpStack using OTAA start by connecting the RAK7200 module to the Computer (see Figure 1) and open the RAK Serial Port  Tool, wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:


```
at+get_config=lora:status
```

```
at+version
```


As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK7200: 

- LoRa¬Æ join mode: **OTAA**
- LoRa¬Æ class: **Class A**
- LoRa¬Æ region: **AU915** 
- Device EUI: **744d4452dd39037c**
- Application EUI: **70B3D57ED001C544**
- Application Key: **4E2003296FC5CD26F46940A6DAFA9D1**



1. Set the LoRa¬Æ join mode to OTAA.

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:0
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Remember, the Application EUI parameter was not required in the ChirpStack platform. Therefore, it is possible to use the same ID as the Device EUI. Otherwise, the firmware will complain. 
::: 

 
6. Set the Application Key.

- Get the Application Key from the TTN register.


```
at+set_config=lora:app_key:4E2003296FC5CD26F46940A6DAFA9D1
```

  caption="Setting LoRa¬Æ Application Key Parameter"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:
After configuring all parameters, you need to reset RAK7200 Module to save the parameters.
:::


7. After resetting, start to join.

```
at+join
```

After 5 or 6 seconds, if the request was successfully received by a LoRa¬Æ gateway, then you should see the messages shown in Figure 53.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/chirpstack-otaa-mode/53.otaa-join-chirpstack.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Chirpstack OTAA Join the Network via RAK Serial Port Tool"
/>

8. You can then see the **JoinRequest** and **JoinAccept** on ChirpStack page.

  width="100%"
  caption="Checking LoRaWAN¬Æ Joint Request in Chirpstack OTAA Console"
/>

- On the ChirpStack platform, you should also see the messages in the LORAWAN FRAMES tab as shown in Figure 55. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:

By convention, messages sent from nodes to gateways are considered as **Uplinks**. While messages sent by gateways to nodes are considered as **Downlinks**.

This concludes the exercise to send data in the OTAA mode.


##### ABP Mode

###### Configure the ABP Mode on the Platform


During the registration of a new device, if you select ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_ABP**‚Äù or "**DeviceProfile_ABP_CN470**", as shown in Figure 56, then the ChirpStack platform will assume that this device will join to the LoRaWAN¬Æ network using the ABP mode. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:

Check ‚Äú**Disable counting frame verification**‚Äù. During the test, when the module is restarted, the frame counting number will be also be restarted from zero. This would cause a synchronization problem with the ChirpStack server treating it as a replay attack. For the testing purpose, it is safe to disable this feature, but remember to activate it in a production environment.

* The parameters can be generated as random numbers by the platform or can be set with user values. Once these parameters are filled properly, the process is completed by clicking on the ‚Äú**ACTIVATE DEVICE**‚Äù button.


###### Configure the ABP mode on the RAK7200


In the following steps, you will configure the RAK7200 module to work in the ABP mode. To set up the RAK7200 module to join ChirpStack using ABP start by connecting the RAK7200 module to the Computer (see Figure 1) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool, wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending either of these two AT commands:

```
at+get_config=lora:status
```

```
at+version
```

As an example, these are the list of the parameters you need to configure in RAK7200: 

- LoRa¬Æ join mode: **ABP**
- LoRa¬Æ class: **Class A**
- LoRa¬Æ region: **AU915** 
- Device address: **019c820a**
- Network Session Key: **34fb174daa6dc34733495f73bd2b1ba1**
- Application Session Key: **d7fde8da53ded21216fe71d4f91ecf0e**

:::tip üìù NOTE:

After configuring all parameters, you need to reset RAK7200 Module for saving parameters.

:::

7. After resetting RAK7200 Module, join in ABP mode.

```
at+join
```

:::tip üìù NOTE:

By using the ABP mode in LoRaWAN¬Æ protocol, it doesn‚Äôt require to join a network before sending LoRaWAN¬Æ package. But to keep the consistency of internal states of the firmware of the RAK7200 module, it still required to send at+join command in the ABP mode. This time, the firmware should reply almost immediately with an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.

:::

Once the RAK7200 joined into a LoRaWAN¬Æ network, it will start to send periodically the data collected from the GPS and other sensors. Then, go to the ChripStack platform to confirm that the messages ware properly received as shown in the Figure 64.

### Miscellaneous

#### Upgrading the Firmware

Before you start working with the RAK7200, it is recommended to keep the RAK7200 module updated to the latest version of the firmware. Download the latest [RAK7200 firmware](/Product-Categories/WisNode/RAK7200/Datasheet/#software).

In this section, you will upgrade the firmware by using the **STM32CubeProgrammer** provided by STM32. Execute the following steps in upgrading the firmware.

1. Install the [**STM32CubeProgrammer**](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stm32cubeprog.html#overview) tool on your Windows PC.

2. Connect the RAK7200 module to the USB interface of a general-purpose computer as shown in Figure 1. 

3. To program the firmware, the RAK7200 module must be entered into the boot mode. You can achieve it by following this procedure:
  - Hold down the BOOT0 button, and then press the Reset button.
  - Release the Reset button, then release the BOOT0 button.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/upgrading-the-firmware/64.reset-button.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK7200 BOOT0 and Reset buttons"
/>

4. Open the **STM32CubeProgrammer** tool and select the UART as the type of connection to the RAK7200 module. Then, configure the following communication parameters:

  - Port: **choose the port assigned by the operative system**
  - Baud rate: **115200**.
  - Parity: **Even**

  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/upgrading-the-firmware/65.uart-parameter.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="STM32CubeProgrammer UART Communication Parameters"
/>

5. Once the connection parameters were properly set, press the **Connect** button located at the top right corner. If there were problems during the connection, the errors would be shown in Log message box. The usual problem is because the RAK7200 didn‚Äôt entered into the boot mode properly. In such cases, you will find similar error messages shown in the Figure 67. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/upgrading-the-firmware/66.error-messages.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Error Messages Received when not in Boot Mode"
/>


6. After connecting successfully, the STM32CubeProgrammer will display **Data read successfully** in the log message box.

  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/upgrading-the-firmware/67.messages-received.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Messages Received when connected in Boot Mode"
/>

7. Once the communication is established with the RAK7200, burn a newer version of firmware into the RAK7200 module:

  - **Erase the existing data**: To avoid unexpected problems during the future usage of the module, it‚Äôs a good practice to erase completely the EEPROM before burning the new version of firmware. You can achieve it by clicking on the Erase button highlighted in red square in Figure 69. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7200/quickstart/upgrading-the-firmware/68.erase-button.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="STM32CubeProgrammer Erase Button"
/>

  - **Select the desired firmware to burn**: Press the ‚ÄúOpen file‚Äù tab, see Figure 68, and select the correct firmware file in the pop-up window as shown in Figure 70.
