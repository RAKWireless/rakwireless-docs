# RAK2560 WisNode Sensor Hub Installation Guide


During installation, make sure that the installer complies with all the necessary safety regulations to ensure personal safety.

:::warning ⚠️ WARNING
Do not place the device and mounting kit on pedestrian walkways to avoid accidental damage to the device or harm to bystanders.

:::tip 📝 NOTE:
Make sure that the rubber seal is fitting nicely in its place to ensure waterproof sealing.
<br>
Make sure that you put enough force in the screwing to properly seal the back cover but not such as to break it.

## Mounting of the Sensor Hub

### Wall Mounting

1. Using a 5&nbsp;mm drill head, drill holes on the wall and plug the screw anchors in the holes.

<rk-img

  width="80%"
  caption="Drilling the wall"
/>

2. Using the tapping screws, attach the mounting bracket to the wall.

  caption="Install the bracket on the wall"

### Pole Mounting

1. Fix the mounting bracket on the pole with one steel strip.

  width="15%"
  caption="Installing the bracket on a pole"
/>

:::tip 📝 NOTE:
The diameter of the pole that is supported by the brackets is 50-80&nbsp;mm. If the pole diameter is more than this value, larger steel strips can be used. The standard mounting kit does not include larger steel strips. If needed, you should purchase them separately.
:::

2. Align the hanging tab of the device with the slot on the bracket, and put the tab into the slot. Then, pull the device down until it clicks in place.

3. Add the security screw on top so the device and bracket are locked together.

## Connecting Probes to the Sensor Hub

### Connecting the Sensor Probe

You have multiple options, depending on the deployment requirements and available space.

1. Connect the Sensor Probe to the Hub directly by plugging the cable into one of the free ports on the main body.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak2560/installation/direct-connection.png"
  width="20%"
  caption="Direct connection"
/>

2. Connect the probe to the Hub via an extender cable for better placement of the Probe.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak2560/installation/connection-via-an-extender.png"
  width="20%"
  caption="Connection via an extender"
/>

3. Connect the Probe to the Hub via a splitter cable for the option to connect multiple Probes to the same port of the Hub.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak2560/installation/connection-via-a-splitter.png"
  width="30%"
  caption="Connection via a splitter"
/>

4. Connect the Probe to the Hub using a splitter and extender cable at once for maximum placement freedom.

### Connecting the Probe IO

RAK2560 Sensor Hub can support third-party sensors through the Probe IO.

1. Remove the lid using a Philips screwdriver.

2. Pass the cable of the sensor through the cable gland and the opening of the Probe IO, connect the cable to the wiring terminal.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak2560/installation/connecting-the-cable.png"
  width="45%"
  caption="Connecting the cable"
