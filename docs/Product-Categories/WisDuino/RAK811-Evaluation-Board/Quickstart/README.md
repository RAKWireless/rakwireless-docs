### LoRa¬Æ P2P Mode

This section shows how to communicate **two (2) WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Boards** via LoRa¬Æ P2P Mode. We will be using EU868 as our frequency, although it is applicable to other standard bands.

1. First, find two WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board which can work on EU868 frequency and make sure their firmware version isn‚Äôt less than V3.0.0.1.

2. Next, connect these two WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board with PC through UART, and open two serial port tool on PC.

3. Now, configure them to both work in LoRa¬Æ P2P mode as follow:

  width="90%"
  caption="P2P Initialization"
/>

4. Then configure LoRa¬Æ P2P parameters for both of them as follow for example:

### Upgrading the Firmware

If the firmware version of your WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board is newer than V3.0.0.0 or you have just burned the bootloader into WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board according to the [Burning Bootloader into the Device](https://doc.rakwireless.com/rak811-lora---evaluation-board/burning-the-bootloader-into-the-device) document, proceed to **Step 2**.

1. In case you have not just burned the bootloader as instructed in the previous section, you need to manually go into **boot mode**. Connect you board via the USB interface and enter the following **AT command** after you have connected via the proper COM port:

::: tip üìù NOTE
Make sure to choose the correct port in the COM Port field. You can check this in the [Interfacing with RAK 811 Development Board](/Product-Categories/WisDuino/RAK811-Evaluation-Board/Quickstart/#interfacing-with-wisduino-rak811-evaluation-board) section.

```sh
at+set_config=device:boot
```

#### Hardware Interfacing

In this section, we will be using an Arduino MEGA 2560 and WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board. Follow the steps thoroughly; any negligence might end up damaging your hardwares.

::: tip üìù NOTE
As of now, our WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board only works with Arduino Mega 2560. Watch out for our future revisions for you to interface it with other Arduino boards.
:::

1. To start with, we are going to differentiate the existing WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Boards or as named in the boards as WisNode-LoRa¬Æ.

#### Firmware Flashing and Testing

##### WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board Bootloader and Firmware

Kindly look into the different sections on how to burn and update the bootloader and firmware of WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board. Both the bootloader and firmware files can be downloaded [here](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/WisNode/Firmware/).

- **Firmware**: [Upgrading the Firmware](/Product-Categories/WisDuino/RAK811-Evaluation-Board/Quickstart/#upgrading-the-firmware)

##### Arduino Demo firmware

1. Open the "**JoinNetworkOTAA.ino**" by navigating through `File>Examples>Arduino-RAK811-Library` in the Arduino IDE.

2. Edit the **Device EUI**, **Application Key and Application EUI** in the "**JoinNetworkOTAA.ino**" which can be obtained in the [Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)](/Product-Categories/WisDuino/RAK811-Evaluation-Board/Quickstart/#connecting-to-the-things-network-ttn) section.

3.Afterwhich, proceed to uploading the sketch by following the steps in the image below:

::: tip üìù NOTE
Make sure to disconnect the connection between the Rx and Tx connection between the WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board and the Arduino Mega 2560. Not doing so will make the sketch uploading fail.

/>

4. You can check the uploading logs shown in the red box in the image above to check whether it is successfully uploaded or not. If the sketch uploading fails, kindly look into each of the logs to address each issue.

##### Test LoRa¬Æ Node with LoRaWAN¬Æ

Using the "JoinNetworkOTAA.ino" sketch in the previous section, it should automatically connect to **TheThingsNetwork(TTN)** through the Gateway in range.

1. Setup and open the two Serial Ports, Arduino USB Port and the SoftwareSerial Port using the USB-UART TTL converter. Kindly reset the WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board and Serial logs must be shown same with the image below:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduino/rak811-evaluation-board/quickstart/firmware-flashing/sxu06fbgafxyxhz3wcum.png"
  width="90%"
  caption="Serial Port View using USB-UART TTL SoftwareSerial Port (left) and Arduino USB Port (right)"
/>

In this section, you might be wondering why we are using two serial ports. As a default, the Arduino Mega 2560 has its own Serial Port which can be viewed through the Serial Monitor. In this port, AT Commands setup are written into the WisDuino RAK811 Evaluation Board for us to be able to connect to TheThingsNetwork(TTN). However, debug logs cannot be printed in the same port for it may interfere with the setup. Thus, a secondary Serial Port must be used as debug logs display using the SoftwareSerial Port shown in the USB-UART TTL converter COM Port.

2. With the successful Serial Logs shown in the image above, we shall then check the logs in the Application Data tab in TheThingsNetwork (TTN). If the connection is successful, received logs must be shown same with the image below:
