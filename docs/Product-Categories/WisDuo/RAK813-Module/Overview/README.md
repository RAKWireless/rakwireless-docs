## Product Description

The **RAK813** is a combination of the BLE and LoRaÂ® in a single module. The BLE short-range technology combined with low-power LoRaÂ® can provide long-distance wireless communication capabilities. Both technologies are low power, eliminating the need to change batteries frequently.

At the same time, RAK813 supports various digital interfaces such as GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI, etc. which are used in connecting sensors to RAK813 module.

Based on the global leading Nordic Semiconductor Corporation's nRF52832 (BLE)
and Semtech's SX127x (LoRaÂ®) chipset, the RAK813 module provides a perfect
combination of ultra low power and ultra long distance.

The RAK813 module uses
TCXO as the LoRaÂ® clock source, so at different temperatures (such as indoor and
outdoor) LoRaÂ® module of radio frequency close to the maximum, can effectively
improve the decoding rate, so as to enhance the communication quality.

RAK813 supports various protocols, including the newest BLE and LoRaWANÂ®, where customers can choose multi frequency, including: 433MHz, 470MHz, 868MHz, and 915MHz.
