# RAK813 BLE+LoRa Module Datasheet



## Overview

### Description

The **RAK813** is a combination of the BLE and LoRa in a single module. The BLE short-range technology combined with low-power LoRa can provide long-distance wireless communication capabilities. Both technologies are low power, eliminating the need to change batteries frequently.

At the same time, RAK813 supports various digital interfaces such as GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI, etc. which are used in connecting sensors to the RAK813 module.

Based on the global leading Nordic Semiconductor Corporation's nRF52832 (BLE) and Semtech's SX127x (LoRa) chipset, the RAK813 module provides a perfect combination of ultra-low-power and ultra-long distance.

The RAK813 module uses TCXO as the LoRa clock source, so at different temperatures (such as indoor and outdoor) LoRa module of radio frequency close to the maximum, can effectively improve the decoding rate, to enhance the communication quality.

RAK813 supports various protocols, including the newest BLE and LoRaWAN, where customers can choose a multi frequency, including 433MHz, 470MHz, 868MHz, and 915MHz.

### Features
