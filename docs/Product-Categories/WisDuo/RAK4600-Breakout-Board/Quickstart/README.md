## Product Configuration


### Interfacing with RAK4600 Breakout Board

To interface with the RAK4600 Breakout Board with your Windows Machine, you need to download the RAK Serial Port Tool **[here](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip).**

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Before powering the RAK4600 Breakout Module, make sure you have installed the included LoRa¬Æ and BLE antennas. Not doing so might damage the board.
:::

- Connect your USB to UART converter to the pin header on the RAK4600 via a set of 4 dupont lines. Use Figure 1 for reference on wiring the device properly.

- Go to your Device Manager by pressing: Windows + R and typing devmgmt.msc or search in the Start Menu.
- Look for Ports (**COM & LPT**) and find the name **USB-SERIAL CH340** and take note of the COM Port Number as you will need it to connect with the board.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Windows 10 should recognize the board and automatically install drivers, however if it is missing in the COM & LP ports list you need to manually install the CH340 Drivers.
:::

- Look for Ports (COM & LPT) and Find the name USB-SERIAL CH340 and take note of the COM Port Number as you will need it to connect with the board. You might have another model number but the wording ‚ÄúUSB-SERIAL‚Äù should be present in some form.

### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

The Things Network is about enabling low power devices to be used in long range gateways that connect to an open-source, decentralized network and exchange data with Applications. Learn more about the Things Network [**here**](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/).

In this section, we will be connecting the RAK4600 Breakout Board to The Things Network (TTN). If you don't have an account yet, head on to [https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create one. Once done, log in to your account and go to the console which can be found here:

#### Adding an Application

- Click the "**add application**" button

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-breakout-board/quickstart/connecting-ttn/adding-application.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Adding an Application"
/>

Here are the things that you should take note in adding an application:

1. **Application ID** - this will be the unique id of your application in the Network. Please note that characters should be in lower case, no spaces are allowed.
2. **Description** - this is a short and concise human readable description of your application.
3. **Application EUI** - this will be generated automatically by The Things Network for convenience.
4. **Handler Registration** - handler you want to register this application to.

After you fill in the necessary information, press the "**Add application**" button at the bottom of this page. If you see the following page, this means that you have successfully registered your application.

- Click "**Register device**"

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-breakout-board/quickstart/connecting-ttn/add-device.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Add your Device"
/>

Here are the things that you should take note in registering your device:

1. **Device ID** - this is the unique identifier for your RAK4600 Breakout Board in your application. You need to enter this manually.
2. **Device EUI** - this is the unique identifier for your device in the network. You can change it later, if you want.
3. **App Key**‚Äì this key will be used to secure the communication between the device and the network.
4. **App EUI**‚Äì a unique identifier of the Application that you are registering the device within.

Populate the **Device ID** and **Device EUI** _(generate a random one by pressing the arrows)_ fields and leave the rest as is.
Click ‚Äú**Register**‚Äù
