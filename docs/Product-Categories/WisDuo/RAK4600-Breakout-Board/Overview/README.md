## Product Description

**RAK4600 Breakout Board** is specifically designed to allow easy excess to the pins on the board in order to simplify development and testing. The breakout board utilized is of an **Xbee form factor** and its main purpose is to allow the RAK4600 stamp module form factor pinout to be transferred to 2.54mm headers.

The board itself has the RAK4600 at its core, integrating an **nRF52832 MCU** and a **SX1276 LoRaÂ® chip**. It has Ultra-Low Power Consumption of 2.0uA in sleep mode, high LoRaÂ® max output power (20dBm) in work mode, and BLE output power up to 4dBm.

The board complies with **LoRaWANÂ® 1.0.2 protocols**. It also supports LoraÂ® Point to Point communication. 

The RF communication capabilities of the board (LoRaÂ® + BLE) make it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field such as home automation, sensor networks, building automation, personal area networks applications (health/fitness sensors and monitors, etc.).
