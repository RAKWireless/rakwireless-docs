# Quick Start Guide

## Introduction

BastWAN puts the RAK4260 module into a Feather compatible format. Developed by [ElectronicCats](http://www.electroniccats.com/) we offer this amazing board in our store. The RAK4260 LPWAN Module used on the BastWAN is based on Microchip‚Äôs SAM R34 (R34J18B ). It is a SiP device integrating a 32-bit ARM Cortex -M0+ MCU with a LoRa Transceiver. It offers full coding support with the Arduino‚Ñ¢ IDE

For more information about the board check the [ElectronicCats BastWAN repository](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/Bast-WAN)

## Hardware Setup

The BastWan is a Feather breakout board with everything you need to get started. 

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Before powering the Feather Board, make sure you have installed the included LoRa Antenna. Not doing so might damage the board
:::

## Software Setup

Here, we will introduce you how to use it with Arduino‚Ñ¢ IDE. 

<!-- The board is like below.

### Burning a bootloader

The BastWAN board comes with pre-flashed bootloader. But if it is necessary to replace the bootloader you can burn the bootloader-bast-wan-v3.4.0.bin with Jlink like below:

## Arduino installation

### BSP installation

1. After download bootloader, Install the BSP library. To add board support for our products, start Arduino and open the Preferences window by navigating through (**File > Preferences**). Now copy and paste the following URL into the '**Additional Boards Manager URLs**' input field: `https://electroniccats.github.io/Arduino_Boards_Index/package_electroniccats_index.json`. Then, press the "**OK**" button.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
If there is already an URL from another manufacturer in that field, click the button at the right end of the field. This will open an editing window allowing you to paste the above URL onto a new line as demonstrated in the image below.

### LoRaWAN library installation

THe BastWAN board uses the Beelan-LoRaWAN library which supports LoRaWAN Class A and Class C implementations operating in EU-868, AS-923, US-915 and AU-915 bands. Visit [here](https://github.com/BeelanMX/Beelan-LoRaWAN) for more information.

## First test

For a quick test we provide source code for a LoRaWan Class A node with OTAA support
