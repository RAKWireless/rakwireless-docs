### What do you need?

Before going through each and every step in the installation guide of the RAK4260 Evaluation Board, make sure to prepare the necessary items listed below:

1. **RAK4260 Evaluation Board**
2. Gateway in Range, for Testing
3. Micro-USB Cable
4. Windows PC
5. RAKDAP1 DapLink tools (not provided)

### What's included in the Package?

* 1-pc RAK4260 EVB (RAK4261 + RAK5005)
* 1-pc Micro USB Cable
* 1-pc LoRa¬Æ Antenna (iPEX)
* 2-pcs 4-pin Header
* 9-pcs Dupont Lines


## Burning the Firmware

**RAK4260**  is an LPWAN Module based on Microchip‚Äôs SIP and the firmware for the RAK4260 can also use the provided SDK of Microchip.

RAK has already compiled a Demo firmware for RAK4260 based on Microchip's SDK that can be downloaded freely for testing purposes in this Github Repository: 
* [https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK4260-LoRaNode-demo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK4260-LoRaNode-demo)

:::tip üìù NOTE
This sample firmware is solely for testing purposes only. If you want to use and deploy your own, you have to make your own customized firmware based on Microchip SDK.

To flash a new firmware we use RAKDAP1, a J-Link/SWD adapter. It requires the Python3 tool pyocd on your computer.

### Installing Environment

#### 1. Install Python3    
Because pyocd needs the Python environment, we must install Python3. We can download the Python3 package from Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it using the default configuration. After installing successfully, we can check the version as follow:    

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4260-breakout-board/quickstart/interfacing/py_ver_check.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="Check Python version"
/>     
:::tip üìù NOTE
If the Python version is above 3.4, pip is automatically installed. But if not, we should install pip3 manually. 
:::
   

#### 2. Install pyocd using pip    
Use the following command to install pyocd:     
```
pip3 install pyocd
```
After installation, check the version of pyocd as follow:    

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4260-breakout-board/quickstart/interfacing/pyocd_ver_check.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="Check pyocd version"
/> 


#### 3. Install the support package for the MCU
After installing pyocd successfully we need to install the support package for the MCU.    
The command format is:
```
pyocd pack --install <MCU model>
```
so the correct command is    
```
pyocd pack --install atsaml21j18a
```

The support packages are MDK packages. You can see a complete list at [https://www.keil.com/dd2/Pack/](https://www.keil.com/dd2/Pack/)

### Flash the firmware using DAPLink and RAKDAP

#### 1. Connect the board to RAKDAP
* Connect the 4 debug/programming SWD pins of the board to the RAKDAP adapter **(VCC | GND | SWIO | SWCLK)**

To flash the `RAK4260_APPS_ENDDEVICE_DEMO.hex` you downloaded before, the command is    
```
pyocd flash -target atsaml21j18a RAK4260_APPS_ENDDEVICE_DEMO.hex
```

Depending on the size of the file, the flashing can take several minutes. The success or failure of the flashing will be shown in the command line:
