# RAK4260 Evaluation Board
Thank you for choosing **RAK4260 Evaluation Board** in your awesome IoT Project! ðŸŽ‰ To help you get started, we have provided you all the necessary documentations for your product.

* [Quick Start Guide](../Quickstart/)

## Product Background

The **RAK4260 Evaluation Board** is a WisBlock product that consists of [RAK4260 WisDuo LPWAN Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak4260-lora-module) in a Breakout board and the [RAK5005-O Base Board](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5005-O/Overview/). This development board allows access to all serial and GPIO ports for easy configuration. The RAK4260 core module includes RAK Unified Interface (RUI) to help you quickly and easily develop and test your firmware.

The RAK4260 module is based on Microchipâ€™s ATSAMR34J18B. It is a SiP device integrating a 32-bit ARM Cortex -M0+ MCU with a LoRaÂ® Transceiver in a 15 millimeter x 15 millimeter compact BGA package.

The SAMR chip provides a number of highly configurable peripherals (configurable as I2C/SPI/UART interfaces). There are 12-bit ADC in addition to the aforementioned.

It is a perfect solution for any LoRaWANÂ® end node developer. The integration of the MCU and LoRaÂ® Transceiver reduces size and minimizes costs. Having such a compact solution within a single package reduces time to market and allows for rapid development and deployment for a number of scenarios.

RAK4260 is a solution that is cost efficient and flexible that can be deployed in a wide variety of IoT scenarios that require long range connectivity and great battery life that LoRaWANÂ® provides.
