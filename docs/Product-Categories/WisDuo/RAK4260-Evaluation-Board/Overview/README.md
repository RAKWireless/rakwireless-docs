## Product Background

The **RAK4260 Evaluation Board** is a WisBlock product that consists of [RAK4260 WisDuo LPWAN Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak4260-lora-module) in a breakout board and the RAK5005 Base Board. This development board allows access to all serial and GPIO ports for easy configuration.

The RAK4260 module is based on Microchip’s ATSAMR34J18B. It is a SiP device integrating a 32-bit ARM Cortex M0+ MCU with a LoRa Transceiver in a 15x15&nbsp;mm compact BGA package.

The SAM R34 chip provides a number of highly peripherals (configurable as I2C/SPI/UART interfaces). There are 12-bit ADC in addition to the aforementioned.

It is a perfect solution for any LoRaWAN end node developer. The integration of the MCU and LoRa transceiver reduces size and minimizes costs. Having such a compact solution within a single package reduces time to market and allows for rapid development and deployment for a number of scenarios.

RAK4260 is a solution that is cost efficient and flexible that can be deployed in a wide variety of IoT scenarios that require long-range connectivity and great battery life that LoRaWAN provides.
