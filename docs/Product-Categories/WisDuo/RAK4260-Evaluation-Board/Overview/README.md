# RAK4260 Evaluation Board
Thank you for choosing **RAK4260 Evaluation Board** in your awesome IoT Project! 🎉 To help you get started, we have provided you all the necessary documentations for your product.

* [Quick Start Guide](../Quickstart/)

## Product Background

The **RAK4260 Evaluation Board** is a WisBlock product that consists of [RAK4260 WisDuo LPWAN Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak4260-lora-module) in a Breakout board and the [RAK5005-O Base Board](/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5005-O/Overview/). This development board allows access to all serial and GPIO ports for easy configuration.

The RAK4260 module is based on Microchip’s ATSAMR34J18B. It is a SiP device integrating a 32-bit ARM Cortex M0+ MCU with a LoRa Transceiver in a 15 millimeter x 15 millimeter compact BGA package.

The SAM R34 chip provides a number of highly peripherals (configurable as I2C/SPI/UART interfaces). There are 12-bit ADC in addition to the aforementioned.

It is a perfect solution for any LoRaWAN end node developer. The integration of the MCU and LoRa Transceiver reduces size and minimizes costs. Having such a compact solution within a single package reduces time to market and allows for rapid development and deployment for a number of scenarios.

RAK4260 is a solution that is cost efficient and flexible that can be deployed in a wide variety of IoT scenarios that require long range connectivity and great battery life that LoRaWAN provides.
