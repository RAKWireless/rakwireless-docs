# RAK4270 WisDuo LPWAN Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK4270 LoRa® Module includes an **STM32L071 MCU** and an **SX1262** LoRa® chip, which supports 8 spreading factors (SF5 ~ SF12) and signal bandwidth that can be adjusted between 7.8 kHz to 500 kHz. It has an ultra-low power consumption of 1.5uA in Sleep Mode, but during the Transmit mode, it can reach the maximum output power of 22 dBm. As a receiver, it can achieve a sensitivity of -138 dBm.

The module complies with the LoRaWAN® 1.0.2 protocol, so it can be used for implementing LoRa® networks or Lora point to point communications. The module is suitable for various applications that require long-range data acquisition and low power consumption, such as smart meters, supply chain and logistics tracking, agricultural sensors, and smart cities.

This module is expected to be controlled by an external controller through its UART interface by sending a set of AT commands. These AT commands control not only the state of this module but also set the LoRaWan communication parameters and payloads (See [RAK AT Command Manual](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4270-Module/LoRaWAN-P2P/AT-Command-Manual/#rak4270-at-command-manual)).

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into seven parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts, and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It covers the parameters of the RAK4270 Module in terms of electrical and mechanical, and the standard operating frequencies of this module.

#### Interfaces

##### SWD Programming Tool

To upgrade the firmware, the SWD (Serial Wire Debug) interface must be used. A 5 pin JLINK cable has to be connected to the SWD port. These pins are 3v3, SWDIO, SWCLK, and MCU_NRST.

##### UARTS ports 


There are two UART ports on the RAK4270 module. UART2 (pin1 and pin2) can be used as the command port, while the UART1 (pin4 and pin5) can be used both as command port and firmware upgrade port. It is recommended to connect the UART2 port to an external MCU and reserve UART1 for debugging and or future firmware upgrade purposes.

##### I2C Port

The RAK4270 exposes an I2C port, in which the SDA line is assigned to the pin9, and the SCL line is assigned to pin10. This I2C port allows you to control additional slave sensors with the RAK4270 using I2C protocol. The RAK4270 will be the master. If the I2C port is used, then external pull-up resistors must be added to the SDA and SCL lines. The recommended value of the resistors is 10 kOhm.


##### RF Port

The RAK4270 module exposes two types of RF antenna: IPEX and PAD. The most straightforward way is to use the IPEX antenna port. In such a case, you just to connect the antenna to the IPEX connector on the module directly. On the other hand, for specific needs, you can design a PCB trace antenna, Chip antenna, SMA antenna, or spring type antenna. In the latter case, the customer should use the PAD type antenna port expose by this module. The external antenna should be matched to the 50 Ohm RF transmission line.

##### VDD Power In

It is recommended to add 4 decoupling capacitors near the module at the entrance of the power supply pin. The recommended values of the capacitor are C1 =10uF, C2=10uF, C3=100nF, C4=100nF.
