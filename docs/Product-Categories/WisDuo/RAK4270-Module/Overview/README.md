## Product Description

The RAK4270 LoRaÂ® Module includes an **STM32L071 MCU** and an **SX1262** LoRaÂ® chip, which supports 8 spreading factors (SF5 ~ SF12) and signal bandwidth that can be adjusted between 7.8 kHz to 500 kHz. It has an ultra-low power consumption of 1.5uA in Sleep Mode, but during the Transmit mode, it can reach the maximum output power of 22 dBm. As a receiver, it can achieve a sensitivity of -138 dBm.

The module complies with the LoRaWANÂ® 1.0.2 protocol, so it can be used for implementing LoRaÂ® networks or Lora point to point communications. The module is suitable for various applications that require long-range data acquisition and low power consumption, such as smart meters, supply chain and logistics tracking, agricultural sensors, and smart cities.

This module is expected to be controlled by an external controller through its UART interface by sending a set of AT commands. These AT commands control not only the state of this module but also set the LoRaWan communication parameters and payloads. (See [RAK AT Command Manual](/Product-Categories/wisduo/rak4270-module/LoRaWAN-P2P/AT-Command-Manual/).)
