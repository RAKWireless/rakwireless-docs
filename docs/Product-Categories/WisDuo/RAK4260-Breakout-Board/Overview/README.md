## Product Description

The **RAK4260 Breakout Board** is specifically designed to allow easy excess to the pins on the board in order to simplify development and testing. The breakout board utilized is of an **Xbee form factor** and its main purpose is to allow the RAK4260 stamp module form factor pinout to be transferred to 2.54&nbsp;mm headers. This makes it more convenient for a developer to debug their solution.

The board itself has the RAK4260 at its core, which is a module that utilizes the **ATSAMR34J18B SIP**. This high level of integration allows for outstanding performance: 860&nbsp;nA in sleep mode and LoRa TX Power of up to 20&nbsp;dBm.

A notable addition to this Breakout Board is the **ATECC608A Cryptographic co-processor** with secure hardware-based key storage. This is what makes this board different (compared to the RAK4200 and RAK4600), adding another level of security in order to future-proof your platform.

The board complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocols. It also supports LoRa Point-to-Point communication.

The low-power, long-range LoRa communication capabilities of the board make it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field such as home automation, sensor networks, building automation, personal area networks applications (health/fitness sensors and monitors, etc.).
