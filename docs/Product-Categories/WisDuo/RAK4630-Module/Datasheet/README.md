# RAK4630 WisBlock LPWAN+BLE Module Datasheet


## Overview

### Description

The RAK4630 is a low-power, long-range transceiver module featuring the Nordic nRF52840 MCU, which supports Bluetooth 5.0 (Bluetooth Low Energy) and the latest SX1262 LoRa transceiver from Semtech. This module adheres to Class A, B, & C specifications of LoRaWAN 1.0.3 and also facilitates LoRa Point-to-Point (P2P) communication mode, enabling rapid implementation of custom LoRa networks. 

With its dual RF communication capabilities (LoRa + BLE), the module is well-suited for diverse IoT applications including home automation, sensor networks, building automation, and various IoT network scenarios.

The default firmware of the RAK4630 is built on RUI3 (RAKwireless Unified Interface), which simplifies using the RAK4630 as a standalone module by enabling the development of custom firmware through RUI APIs. This setup allows direct interfacing with sensors and other external peripherals without requiring an additional MCU. Additionally, the RAK4630 can communicate with an external host MCU using AT commands via USB, UART, or BLE connection.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
When using `RF_LoRa` and `RF_BT` pins for antenna and not the IPEX connector variant, there are design considerations to make sure optimum RF performance.

- RF trace must be away from interference (switching node of DC-DC supply, high current/voltage pulses from controllers of inductive load like motor, signal generators, etc.)
- RF trace must have 50&nbsp;Ohms impedance. It is advisable to use an impedance simulation software tool to achieve this requirement.
- If using an external antenna connector, make it close to the `RF_LoRa` and `RF_BT` pins.
- Ground plane optimization is critical on certain antenna types like monopole.
- GND trace used for RF path return must be directly connected to the GND plane and not be treated as thermal relief.
- It is recommended for the RF trace to be routed in a curve and not in a sharp 90&nbsp;degrees.

In addition, with a commitment to making IoT easy, RAK offers a dedicated service for [Antenna RF Design](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/antenna-rf-design-service-including-pcb-design-tuning-matching-and-rf-test) which includes PCB design, tuning, matching, and RF testing.

##### Setup of the SX1262

Information for writing custom firmware for the RAK4630 includes details about the internal connections between the RAK4630 and the necessary initialization parameters for the SX1262 LoRa Transceiver.

| nRF52840 GPIO	| SX1262 Pin | function                          |
| :-----------: | :--------: | :-------------------------------: |
| P1.10         | NSS        | SPI NSS                           |
| P1.11         | SCK        | SPI CLK                           |
| P1.12         | MOSI       | SPI MOSI                          |
| P1.13         | MISO       | SPI MISO                          |
| P1.14         | BUSY       | BUSY signal                       |
| P1.15         | DIO1       | DIO1 event interrupt              |
| P1.06         | NRESET     | NRESET manual reset of the SX1262 |

Important for a successful SX1262 initialization:
- Set up DIO2 to control the antenna switch.
- Set up DIO3 to control the TCXO power supply.
- Set up the SX1262 to use it's DCDC regulator and not the LDO.
- The RAK4630 schematics show GPIO P1.07 connected to the antenna switch, but it should not be initialized, as DIO2 will control the antenna switch.
