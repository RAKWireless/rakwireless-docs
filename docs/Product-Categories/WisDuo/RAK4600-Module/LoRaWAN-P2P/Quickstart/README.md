## Product Configuration

### Interfacing with RAK4600

In this section, a RAK4600 module is used for demonstration. Use a USB to TTL module to connect to the module. In case the RAK4600 is mounted on an evaluation board or a customized PCB then use the appropriate interface to connect to the Serial port.

1.	Connect the RAK4600 to the serial port of a general-purpose (e.g.: USB port) using a USB to TTL adapter, as shown in Figure 1. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/usb-ttl.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="RAK4600 module connection"
/>

2.	Any serial communication tool will work, but it is recommended to use the RAK Serial Port Tool that can be downloaded from here:
    * [https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip)

3.	Configure the serial communication tool by selecting the proper port of the computer UART port and configure the link as: **115200 bauds, 8 bits, no parity bit, and 1 stop bit**.

* In choosing the correct COM Port number for your device. Go to your Device Manager by pressing : **Windows + R** and type `devmgmt.msc` or search in the Start Menu.

<rk-img

### Configure the RAK4600

#### Through UART

In order to connect the RAK4600 module to a LoRa-P2P connection or a LoRaWAN¬Æ¬Æ network, the module must be configured and LoRa¬Æ parameters must be set by sending AT commands through the UART interface.

Connect the RAK4600 module to the computer as described in the previous section. Using the Serial communication tool then is possible to send commands to the RAK4600, e.g.: sending the `at+version` will display the current firmware version as shown in Figure 4.

The full set of RAK4600 AT commands can be found in Appendix I.

<rk-img

### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

In this section, a practical exercise will be performed to show how to connect the RAK4600 module to The Thing Network (TTN‚Ñ¢) platform.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/ttn-context.png"
  width="75%"
  caption="RAK4600 in the context of the TTN"
/>

As shown in Figure 12, the RAK4600 module is one of the devices located on the left side. In the context of an IoT solution, the objective is to deploy devices to sense the relevant process variables and transmit the data to the backend servers located in the cloud. The data will be processed and integrated as part of a larger solution that, ultimately, could generate efficiency, traceability, predictability capacity among others.

The RAK4600 module can be part of this ecosystem, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple is to send data to the TTN using the LoRaWAN¬Æ¬Æ protocol. To achieve this, the RAK4600 module must be located inside of the coverage of a LoRaWAN¬Æ¬Æ gateway. 


<b>Sign up and login</b>

If you don't have an account yet, head on to the [TTN website](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create one. Once done, login to your account and go to the Console.

#### LoRaWAN¬Æ Join Mode

The LoRaWAN¬Æ¬Æ specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN¬Æ¬Æ network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via **Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA)** or via **Activation-By-Personalization (ABP)**. In OTAA the end-device previously personalized is activated when is deployed or reset. In ABP, personalization and activation are done as a single step.

##### OTAA mode

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the TTN platform

As shown in Figure 20, the default activation mode in TTN is the OTAA mode. Therefore, no further actions are required on the platform side. Three parameters from the TTN setup are used to configure the RAK4600: ‚Äú**Device EUI**‚Äù, ‚Äú**Application EUI**‚Äù and ‚Äú**App Key**‚Äù.

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK4600

RAK4600 complies with LoRaWAN¬Æ¬Æ 1.0.2, by default the LoRa¬Æ join mode is **OTAA** and the LoRa¬Æ Class is **Class A**.

To set up the RAK4600 module to join the TTN using OTAA start by connecting the RAK4600 module to the Computer (as in Figure 1) and open the RAK Serial Port Tool, wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending an AT command as:

```
at+get_config=lora:status
```
or 
```
at+version
```

### Connecting with ChirpStack

This section shows how to connect the RAK4600 module to the ChirpStack platform. As described in the ChripsStack‚Äôs website:

‚ÄúThe ChirpStack open-source LoRaWAN¬Æ¬Æ Network Server stack provides open-source components for LoRaWAN¬Æ¬Æ networks. Together they form a ready-to-use solution including a user-friendly web-interface for device management and APIs for integration. The modular architecture makes it possible to integrate within existing infrastructures. All components are licensed under the MIT license and can be used for commercial purposes.‚Äù

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-architecture.png"
  width="60%"
  caption="RAK4600 module in the context of the ChirpStack platform"
/>

The architecture of the ChirpStack platform is shown in Figure 33. Similar to the case of TTN, the RAK4600 module is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa¬Æ gateway. More information about this architecture can be found at: [https://www.chirpstack.io/](https://www.chirpstack.io/)

* In this document, it is assumed that users are using a RAK LoRa¬Æ gateway, such as RAK7243. The gateway must be configured and registered previously to ChirpStack deployment. More information about that can be found at: [Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7243/Quickstart/#connect-the-gateway-with-chirpstack)

* Customers can provide their ChirpStack deployment or use the one provided by RAK for testing purposes. RAK has enabled a set of LoRaServer on the cloud to support customers to test their RAK LoRa gateway or RAK LoRa node. The table below shows the IP address for the supported regions. Submit your request in the following URL to get an account and password: [https://forum.rakwireless.com/t/rak-free-cloud-loraserver-for-testing/344/45](https://forum.rakwireless.com/t/rak-free-cloud-loraserver-for-testing/344/45)

|Frequency|IP Address|
|---------|----------|
|CN470|106.15.233.112|
|EU868|47.88.62.184|
|US915|106.15.239.64|
|AS923|47.101.11.150|
|IN865|139.155.10.119|

* In summary, these are the requirements: 

  1.	Have an account at the ChirpStack deployment provided by RAK. 
  2.	Have access to a LoRaWAN¬Æ gateway registered at the RAK‚Äôs ChirpStack server. (The frequency band set for the RAK4600 needs to be consistent with the frequency band of the gateway.) [Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7243/Quickstart/#connect-the-gateway-with-chirpstack)
  3.	The RAK Serial Port Tool provided by RAK.
  4.	The RAK4600 module. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:
The frequency band used in this example is EU868 which is supported by the high-frequency version of RAK4600.
:::

* And these are the steps to send data to the ChirpStack platform from a RAK4600 module: 

  1. Request an account to RAK and login to the RAK‚Äôs ChirpStack platform. 
  2. Create a new Application.
  3. Register a new device on the platform: 
  4. Configure the Join Mode:
      *	OTAA mode on the platform
      *	OTAA mode on the RAK4600 module
      *	ABP mode on the platform
      *	ABP mode on the RAK4600 module
  5. Send data from the module and receive it at the platform

The following section gives the details of each of these aforementioned steps. As usual, the user must choose to use ABP or OTAA mode to register the device to the network server.

<b>Sign up and login</b>

Request an account in the forum of RAK, then access to server assigned for your region with your username and password. 

#### Create a new Application

Go to the Application section as shown in Figure 33.

#### LoRaWAN¬Æ Join Mode

The LoRaWAN¬Æ specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN¬Æ network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or via Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). In OTAA the end-device previously personalized is activated when is deployed or reset. In ABP, personalization and activation are done as a single step.

##### OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the platform

1. If you have selected ‚Äú**DeviceProfile_OTAA**‚Äù as shown in Figure 40, then after the device is created, an Application Key must be also created for this device. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-otaa.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Choosing OTAA mode in the device registration form"
/>

2. A previously created Application Key can be entered here or a new one can be generated automatically by clicking the icon highlighted in red in Figure 42:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-otaa-appkey.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key for the OTAA mode in the device registration form"
/>

3. Once the Application Key is added in the form, the process can be finalized by clicking on the ‚Äú**SET DEVICE-KEYS**‚Äù button. 

* As shown in Figure 43, a new device should be listed in the DEVICES tab. The most important parameters, such as the **Device EUI** is shown in the summary. 

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-deveui.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="New crated device listed in the DEVICES tab"
/>

4. To end the process, it is a good practice to review that the Application Key is properly associated with this device. The Application Key can be verified in the KEYS(OTAA) tab as shown in Figure 44.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/chirpstack-appkey.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key associated to the new device"

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Standard OTAA mode requires the Device EUI, Application Key, and the Application EUI, but in the ChirpStack‚Äôs implementation, only Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required and is not recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, the Application EUI is a mandatory parameter in the RAK4600 module‚Äôs firmware, in order to resolve this mismatch, users can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration in the side of the node. 
:::

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK4600

RAK4600 complies with LoRaWAN¬Æ 1.0.2, by default the LoRa join mode is **OTAA** and the LoRa Class is **Class A**. 

To set up the RAK4600 module to join ChirpStack using OTAA start by connecting the RAK4600 module to the Computer (as in Figure 1) and open the RAK Serial Port  Tool, wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending an AT command as:

```
at+get_config=lora:status
```

### LoRa¬Æ P2P Mode

This section will show how to set and link two RAK4600 units to work in LoRa¬Æ P2P mode.

1. The two RAK4600 units shall be set to operate at the same frequency, (For this demonstration: EU868)

2. As shown in the previous sections, the setup of the RAK4600 units is done by connecting them with a general-purpose computer through the UART port (see Figure 1). The setup of each RAK4600 can be done separately, but testing the LoRa¬Æ P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously to a UART port (This could be one computer with 2 ports or 2 computers with one UART port each).

3. To set the RAK4600 to work in LoRa¬Æ P2P mode, open the RAK Serial port tool and send the command as in Figure 56:

```
at+set_config=lora:work_mode:1
```
<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/p2p-work-mode.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="RAK4600 setting to LoRa P2P mode"
/>

4. Configure the LoRa P2P parameters for both units. The command for setting the parameters has the format.

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:XXX:Y:Z:A:B:C
```

* Based on the [AT Commands for RAK4600](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4600-Module/LoRaWAN¬Æ-P2P/AT-Command-Manual/), the parameters are:

  *	**XXX**: Frequency in Hz.
  *	**Y**: Spreading factor, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
  *	**Z**: Bandwidth, [0: 125 kHz,1: 250 kHz,2: 500kHz]
  *	**A**: Coding Rate, [1: 4/5, 2: 4/6, 3: 4/7, 4: 4/8]
  *	**B**: Preamble Length, 5~65535.
  *	**C**: Power in dBm, 5~20.

For this example, the LoRa parameters are:
*	**Link frequency**: 869525000 Hz
*	**Spreading factor**:7
*	**Bandwidth**: 125 kHz
*	**Coding Rate**:4/5
*	**Preamble Length**: 5
*	**Power**: 5 dBm

5. Which is translated into the following RAK4600 AT command and that is sent to both units as shown in Figure 57:

```
at+set_config=lorap2p:869525000:7:0:1:5:5
```

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/p2p-param-example.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Setting both RAK4600 units with the LoRa P2P parameters"
/>

6. Next, set the transmission mode of the module. In this example, Unit 1 is set to sender mode, and Unit 2 is set to receiver mode by AT command. See Figure 58.
  * **Unit 1** (Sender):		
```
at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:2
```
  * **Unit 2** (Receiver):	
```
at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:1
```

  width="80%"
  caption="Set the module in the sender (left) and the receiver (right) mode"
/>

7. Now, to send a message with the string ‚Äú**123456890**‚Äù from Unit1 to Unit2, use the command on Unit 1:

```
at+send=lorap2p:1234567890
```
* The message will be automatically received by Unit 2 (see Figure 59).

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/p2p-send-data.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Sending a message from RAK unit 1(left) to RAK unit 2 (right)"
/>

### Bluetooth Interface

Starting on the version V3.0.0.6, there are three BLE modes in RAK4600 module: **Peripheral mode**, **Central mode**, and **Beacon scan mode**. 

1. **Peripheral mode**: you can scan RAK4600‚Äôs BLE and connect with it using your normal mobile devices.
2. **Central mode**: the RAK4600‚Äôs BLE will not broadcast so that your normal mobile devices will not able to scan it. But it is useful for IoT use case, for example, you can connect some BLE sensor node to the RAK4600 module. By setting the module in the central mode, the RAK4600 module acts as a BLE gateway. In the central mode, "Nordic UART Service" is supported.
3. **Beacon scan mode**: the RAK4600 module will scan the surrounding BLE signal, it is useful for Beacon use case like iBeacon.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
For the central and beacon scan patterns, you need to use the API development of Rui to play its role. You can refer to the following address for BLE related API interfaces: [RUI API Reference](/RUI/)
:::

By default, RAK4600‚Äôs BLE will work in the peripheral mode so that users can config it over BLE including DFU easily, but you should know that every time after resetting, you have only 60 seconds to connect your mobile device with RAK4600 over BLE, because of power consumption. If you don‚Äôt connect with RAK4600 in 60 seconds after resetting it, RAK4600‚Äôs BLE will not broadcast for saving power, but there is no limitation once your mobile device has connected with RAK4600 over BLE in 60 seconds.

Surely, you can set RAK4600‚Äôs BLE to work in the central mode, when RAK4600 is reset, there will be 30 seconds that RAK4600‚Äôs BLE works in the peripheral mode for users to connect RAK4600 through BLE using their mobile device and configure RAK4600 over BLE, in this case, if you don‚Äôt connect with RAK4600 through BLE in 30 seconds, RAK4600‚Äôs BLE will work in the central mode automatically and it can not be scanned by your mobile devices until you change the work mode to the peripheral mode or reset RAK4600 again.


## Miscellaneous

### Upgrading the Firmware

Before to start working with the RAK4600, it is recommended to keep the RAK4600 module updated to the latest version of the firmware. The latest firmware can be found in the software section of the [RAK4600 Module Datasheet](/Product-Categories/WisDuo/RAK4600-Module/Datasheet/#firmware).

In the following sections, two (2) options for flashing new firmware in a RAK4600 module are shown: **Upgrade through DAPLink** and **Upgrade through UART1**.

#### Firmware Upgrade Through DAPLink

To flash a new firmware we use RAKDAP1, a J-Link/SWD adapter. It requires the Python3 tool pyocd on your computer.

##### Installing Environment

1.  Install Python3   

Because **pyocd** needs the **Python environment**, we must install **Python3**. We can download the Python3 package from Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it using the default configuration. After installing successfully, we can check the version as follow:    

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/py_ver_check.png"
  width="40%"
  caption="Check Python version"
/> 

:::tip üìù NOTE:
If the Python version is above 3.4, pip is automatically installed. But if not, we should install pip3 manually.     
:::

2. Install pyocd using pip

Use the following command to install pyocd:     

```
pip3 install pyocd   
```

* After installation, check the version of pyocd as follow:    

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/pyocd_ver_check.png"
  width="20%"
  caption="Check pyocd version"
/> 
   
3. Install the support package for the MCU

After installing pyocd successfully we need to install the support package for the MCU. The command format is:

```
pyocd pack --install <MCU model>
```

**Example**: The MCU models for this board is **stm32l151cb** so the correct command is:

```
pyocd pack --install stm32l151cb
```

The support packages are MDK packages. You can see a complete list at [https://www.keil.com/dd2/Pack/](https://www.keil.com/dd2/Pack/).

##### Flash the firmware using DAPLink and RAKDAP

1. Connect the board to RAKDAP

Connect the 4 debug/programming SWD pins of the board to the RAKDAP adapter(| VCC | GND | SWIO | SWCLK |)

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4600-module/quickstart/rak4600-swd.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK4600 to SWD debug pins"
/> 

2. Flash the latest firmware

To flash the latest firmware version the command is:

```
pyocd flash -target stm32l151cb <path/to/file.bin>
```    

* Depending on the size of the file, the flashing can take several minutes. The success or failure of the flashing will be shown in the command line:
