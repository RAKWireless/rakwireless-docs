# LoRa¬Æ Module Deep Development Reference

## Overview

The product portfolio of RAK LoRa¬Æ node RAK4600 module. This module come with a standard version of firmware that allow the customers to integrate quickly these modules in their solutions for LoRaWAN¬Æ or LoRa¬Æ P2P communication through the AT commands interface.

Further customization of the firmware can be done through the RUI Online compiler. At this layer the customized firmware interface with the hardware through the RUI Core abstraction layer. In RAK we called this a secondary firmware development/customization.  

Additionally, RAK offers a third alternative for advance customers who need to have a deeper integration of their solutions with these modules. In this alternative, the customer could develop their own version of firmware that runs inside of the RAK modules.

## How to Implement your App on RAK Module

### Schematic

One of the essential aspects that allow customers to develop their own version of firmware is the module‚Äôs hardware schematic. This allow the customers to understand the module‚Äôs pinout, connections between the inner MCU and the LoRa¬Æ transceiver.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
There are two version of RAK4600 module. One for the high frequency bands (i.e. 915MHz, 866 MHz) and one for the low frequency bands (i.e.433 MHz). While RAK4600 share the same connections between high frequency and low frequency models.

### Porting Lora Protocol Stack

When implementing the LoRa¬Æ protocol stack, special attention must be paid in the SPI connections, since the LoRa¬Æ transceivers are controlled by the MCU through a SPI interface. The important pins are: **SPI1_MISO, SPI1_MOSI, SPI_NSS, SPI_CLK**. Additionally, the DIO, RFI path are important as well to have a functioning LoRa¬Æ communication.

After that, **Real Time CLock (RTC)** must be properly configured in the MCU to ensure accurate timing of protocol stack during the runtime.

Finally, the protocol stack code can be added after other pins are configured.

### Application

Once the porting the protocol stack is ready, customers can focus on the development of their applications. There are two options: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Do not use the original bootloader that comes in RAK modules from the factory. In the case, the customer must provide his own version of bootloader.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Use RAK's bootloader and the upgrade the custom firmware by using nRF Connect. You can download it from here: [https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Connect-for-mobile](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Connect-for-mobile)

If you want to fully develop your own, you can refer to the schematic diagram and the datasheet of the MCU to implement the code. If you want to use RAK‚Äôs bootloader, please continue reading the next section.

### Bootloader

In any MCU, after the power is connected, the System bootloader is on charge to bootstrap all the necessary to setup the Interrupt Vector table, initialize variables, and jump to the address of the main() symbol.

In the following image shows a usual memory map for an ARM Cortex M4 MCU, which is the architecture of the MCU of the RAK4600

The flash section is between the 0x0800 0000 and 0x080X 0000. The X depends on the different models of MCU.

In the case of RAK4600 module, its internal MCU is based on the nRF52832, its bootloader involves security verification. You need to use Nordic SDK to compile your own security bootloader. The Nordic SDK version we use is v15.0.0. The relevant routines can be found at ‚Äú**examples/dfu/secure_ bootloader**‚Äù sample code in SDK.
