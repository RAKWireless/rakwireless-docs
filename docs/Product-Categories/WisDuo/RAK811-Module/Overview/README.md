## Product Description

RAK811 Low-Power Long Range LoRa Technology Transceiver module provides an easy to use, small size and low-power solution for long range wireless data applications.

The RAK811 module complies with the latest LoRaWAN Class A & C protocol specifications, it is simple to access LWPA IOT platforms, such Actility etc. It also supports LoRa Point to Point communications (P2P) , this function can help customers implement their own private long range LoRa network fast.

The RAK811 Module is integrated with Semtech's SX1276 and STM32L which offers user a way communicating with AT Commands through UART Interface. Users will also be able to make their projects turn into reality such as Long Range Sensor data applications, RAK811 also offers a low power feature that is suitable for battery powered applications.
