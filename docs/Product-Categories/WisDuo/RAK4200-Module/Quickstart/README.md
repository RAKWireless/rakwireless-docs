### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

This section shows how to connect the RAK4200 module to The Things Network (TTN) platform.
As described in the TTN’s website:
"The engine of The Things Network is our technology - a robust yet flexible and enterprise-ready LoRaWAN network server stack. Our stack caters to the needs of demanding LoRaWAN deployments, from covering the essentials to advanced security configurations and device life cycle management. Backed by SLAs to meet your availability requirements, facilitated by our team of support engineers"

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/RAK4200-ttn.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="RAK4200 in the context of the TTN"
/>

As shown in Figure 6, the RAK4200 module is one of the devices located on the left side. In the context of an IoT solution, the objective is to deploy devices to sense the relevant process variables and transmit the data to the backend servers located in the cloud. The data will be processed and integrated as part of a larger solution that, ultimately, could generate efficiency, traceability, predictability capacity among others.

The RAK4200 module can be part of this ecosystem, and the objective of this section is to demonstrate how simple is to send data to TTN using LoRaWAN. Users must be aware that to achieve this, the RAK4200 must be located inside of coverage of a LoRaWAN gateway.

In summary, these are the requirements:

- Have an account on the TTN website.
- Have access to a LoRaWAN gateway subscribed to the TTN. The frequency band set for the RAK4200 needs to be consistent with the frequency band of the gateway.
- The "RAK Serial Port Tool" provided by RAKWireless.
- The RAK4200 module is connected to USB to TTL adapter, as shown in Figure 1.

::: tip 📝 NOTE
The frequency band used in this example is EU868 which is supported by the high-frequency version of the RAK4200 module.
:::

The steps for sending data to the TTN platform from a RAK4200 module can be summarized as:

- Sign up and login to TTN console.
- Create a new Application.
- Register a new device in the platform
- Configure the Join Mode
   - OTAA mode on the platform
   - OTAA mode on the RAK4200 module
   - ABP mode on the platform
   - ABP mode on the RAK4200 module
   - Send data from the module and receive it at the platform

In the following sections, each of these steps will be explained in detail. The user must choose to use ABP or OTAA mode to register the device on the network server.

#### Registering the RAK4200 to TTN

To register the RAK4200 to TTN, execute the following steps:

##### Login to the Things Network platform

Access and login into the [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), and go to its “Console” section by clicking on the Console icon. You should see an interface similar to Figure 7.

In this form, the device ID must be unique for the application and must be completed with a lower case, alphanumeric characters. The rest of the parameters in the form are very important for the LoRaWAN protocol:

- Device EUI
- Application Key
- Application EUI

The TTN platform can generate these parameters randomly by leaving those fields empty or the user can enter already existing values.

Press the “Register” button to finish the process. The registration results will appear summarized as in Figure 14.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/ttn-console-6.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="TTN Console creating a new Device."
/>

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

The LoRaWAN specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or via Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). In OTAA, the end-device previously personalized is activated when deployed or reset. In ABP, personalization and activation are done as a single step.

##### Join in OTAA mode

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the TTN platform

As shown in Figure 15, the default activation mode in TTN is the OTAA mode. Therefore, no further actions are required on the platform side.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/ttn-console-6.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="TTN’s Console, the results of creating a new Device."
/>

Three parameters from TTN setup are used to configure the RAK4200: “Device EUI”, “Application EUI” and “App Key”.

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK4200 module

“The ChirpStack open-source LoRaWAN Network Server stack provides open-source components for LoRaWAN networks. Together they form a ready-to-use solution including a user-friendly web-interface for device management and APIs for integration.

The modular architecture makes it possible to integrate within existing infrastructures. All components are licensed under the MIT license and can be used for commercial purposes.”

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/RAK4200-module.png"
  width="70%"
  caption="RAK4200 module in the context of the ChirpStack platform"
/>

The architecture of the ChirpStack platform is shown in Figure 28. Similar to the case of TTN, the RAK4200 module is located in the periphery and will transmit the data to the backend servers through a LoRa gateway. For more information about this architecture, refer to [Chirpstack website](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

In this document, it is assumed that users are using a RAK LoRa gateway, such as RAK7243. The gateway must be configured and registered previously to Chirpstack deployment. For further details, refer to [RAKwireless LoRa Downloads](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/).

::: tip 📝 NOTE
The frequency band used in this example is EU868 which is supported by the high-frequency version of RAK4200.
:::

And these are the steps to send data to the ChirpStack platform from a RAK4200 module:

- Create a new Application.
- Register a new device on the platform:
- Configure the Join Mode:
  - OTAA mode on the platform
  - OTAA mode on the RAK4200 module
  - ABP mode on the platform
  - ABP mode on the RAK4200 module
  - Send data from the module and receive it at the platform

The following section gives the details of each of these aforementioned steps. As usual, the user must choose to use ABP or OTAA mode to register the device to the network server.

#### Registering the RAK4200 to ChirpStack

#### LoRaWAN Join Mode

The LoRaWAN specification defines that to join in a LoRaWAN network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation can be done either via Over-The-Air-Activation (OTAA) or via Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). In OTAA, the end-device previously personalized is activated when deployed or reset. In ABP, personalization and activation are done as a single step.

##### Join in OTAA Mode

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the platform

If you have selected “device_profile_otaa” as shown in Figure 37, then after the device is created, an Application Key must be also created for this device.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/choosing-otaa-mode.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Choosing OTAA mode in the device registration form"
/>

A previously created Application Key can be entered here, or a new one can be generated automatically by clicking the icon highlighted in red in Figure 38:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/app-key-for-otaa.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key for the OTAA mode in the device registration form"
/>

Once the Application Key is added in the form, the process can be finalized by clicking on the “SET DEVICE-KEYS” button.

As shown in Figure 39, a new device should be listed in the DEVICES tab. The most important parameters, such as the Device EUI, are shown in the summary.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/new-created-device.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="New crated device listed in the DEVICES tab"
/>

To end the process, it is a good practice to review that the Application Key is properly associated with this device. The Application Key can be verified in the KEYS (OTAA) tab as shown in Figure 40.

  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/app-key-associated.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Key associated with the new device."
/>

::: tip 📝 NOTE
Standard OTAA mode requires the Device EUI, Application Key, and the Application EUI; but in the ChirpStack implementation, only Device EUI and the Application Key are mandatory. The Application EUI is not required nor recorded in the Application tab. Nevertheless, the Application EUI is a mandatory parameter in the RAK4200 module firmware. To resolve this mismatch, users can reuse the Device EUI as the Application EUI during the configuration in the side of the node.
:::

###### Configure the OTAA mode on the RAK4200 module

RAK4200 complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification. By default, the LoRa join mode is OTAA, and the LoRa Class is Class A.
To set up the RAK4200 module to join ChirpStack using OTAA, start by connecting the RAK4200 module to the Computer (as shown in Figure 1). Open the RAK Serial Port Tool, and wait for the communication to start. It is recommended to test the serial communication by sending an AT command as `at+get_config=lora:status` or `at+version`.

### LoRa P2P Mode

This section will show how to set and link two RAK4200 units to work in LoRa P2P mode.
The two RAK4200 units shall be set to operate at the same frequency, e.g: EU868.

As shown in the previous sections, the setup of the RAK4200 units is done by connecting them with a general-purpose computer through the UART port. The setup of each RAK4200 can be done separately, but testing the LoRa P2P mode will require having both units connected simultaneously to a UART port (this could be one computer with 2 ports or 2 computers with one UART port each).

To set the RAK4200 to work in LoRa P2P mode, open the RAK Serial port tool and send the command as shown in Figure 51: `at+set_config=lora:work_mode:1`

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/RAK4200-setting.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="RAK4200 setting to LoRa P2P mode"
/>

Configure the LoRa P2P parameters for both units. The command for setting the parameters has the format.
`at+set_config=lorap2p:XXX:Y:Z:A:B:C`

From Table 6 the parameters are:

- XXX: Frequency in Hz.
- Y: Spreading factor, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
- Z: Bandwidth, [0: 125 kHz,1: 250 kHz,2: 500kHz]
- A: Coding Rate, [1: 4/5, 2: 4/6, 3: 4/7, 4: 4/8]
- B: Preamble Length, 5~65535.
- C: Power in dBm, 5~20.

For this example, the LoRa parameters are:

- Link frequency: 869525000 Hz
- Spreading factor:7
- Bandwidth: 125 kHz
- Coding Rate:4/5
- Preamble Length: 5
- Power: 5 dBm

It is translated into the following [RAK4200 AT command](../AT-Command-Manual/) that is sent to both units as shown in Figure 54:
`at+set_config=lorap2p:869525000:7:0:1:5:5`

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-module/quickstart/setting-both-units.png"
  width="50%"
  caption="Setting both RAK4200 units with the LoRa P2P parameters"
/>

Next, set the transmission mode of the module. In this example, Unit 1 is set to sender mode, and unit 2 is set to receiver mode by AT command. See Figure 53.

Unit 1(Sender): `at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:2`
Unit 2(Receiver): `at+set_config=lorap2p:transfer_mode:1`

  width="100%"
  caption="Set the module in the sender (left) and in the receiver (right) mode"
/>

To send a message with the string “123456890” from Unit 1 to Unit 2, use the command on Unit 1.
`at+send=lorap2p:1234567890`

The message will be automatically received by Unit 2. See Figure 56.
