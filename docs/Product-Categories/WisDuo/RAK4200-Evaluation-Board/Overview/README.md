## Product Description

**RAK4200 Evaluation Board** is a WisBlock product consisting of [RAK4200 WisDuo LPWAN Module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak4200-lora-module) and RAK5005 Base Board. You can use this development board to access all serial and GPIO ports for easy configuration. RAK4200 includes an STM32L071KB MCU and an SX1276 LoRa transceiver. This evaluation board uses a RAK4200 module which is a LoRa module that has an Ultra-Low Power Consumption of 9.40&nbsp;μA (down to 1.08&nbsp;μA @ 2.0&nbsp;V) in sleep mode and high LoRa output power up to 19&nbsp;dBm max in work mode. The module complies with the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification. It also supports LoRa P2P (Point-to-Point) communications. The module is suitable for various applications that require long-range data acquisition and low power consumption.
