## Product Configuration

### Interfacing with RAK4200 Breakout Board

In order for you to be able to interface with the RAK4200 Evaluation Board with your Windows Machine, you need to download the RAK Serial Port Tool **[here](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip).**

::: warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Before powering the RAK4200 Breakout Board, make sure you have installed the included LoRa Antenna. Not doing so might damage the board
:::

- Connect your USB to UART converter to the pin header on the RAK4200 via a set of 4 dupont lines. Use **Figure 1** for reference on wiring the device properly.

- Go to your Device Manager by pressing: Windows + R and typing devmgmt.msc or search in the Start Menu.

::: tip üìù NOTE
Windows 10 should recognize the board and automatically install drivers, however if it is missing in the COM & LP ports list you need to manually install the CH340 Drivers.
:::

- Look for Ports (COM & LPT) and Find the name USB-SERIAL CH340 and take note of the COM Port Number as you will need it to connect with the board. You might have another model number but the wording ‚ÄúUSB-SERIAL‚Äù should be present in some form.

### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

The Things Network is about enabling low power devices to be used in long range gateways that connect to an open-source, decentralized network and exchange data with Applications. Learn more about the Things Network [**here**](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/).

In this section, we will be connecting the RAK4200 Breakout Board to The Things Network (TTN). If you don't have an account yet, head on to [TTN site](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create one. Once done, Log in to your account and go to the console which can be found here:

- Choose "**APPLICATIONS**"

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-breakout-board/quickstart/ttn/add-application.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Application Page"

#### Adding An Application

- Click the "**add application**" button

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisduo/rak4200-breakout-board/quickstart/ttn/application-input.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Adding an Application"
/>

Here are the things that you should take note in adding an application:

1. **Application ID** - this will be the unique id of your application in the Network. Please note that characters should be in lower case, no spaces are allowed.
2. **Description** - this is a short and concise human readable description of your application.
3. **Application EUI** - this will be generated automatically by The Things Network for convenience.
4. **Handler Registration** - handler you want to register this application to.

- After you fill in the necessary information, press the "**Add application**" button at the bottom of this page. If you see the following page, this means that you have successfully registered your application.

  width="100%"
  caption="Add your Device"
/>

Here are the things that you should take note in registering your device:

1. **Device ID** - this is the unique identifier for your RAK4200 Breakout Board in your application. You need to enter this manually.
2. **Device EUI** - this is the unique identifier for your device in the network. You can change it later, if you want.

Click the following icon and the Device EUI will be automatically generated. The App Key should be in auto generation mode by default.

- Lastly, click the Register button. Now, your device is registered under the corresponding application.

Depending on which authentication method you want to use ,proceed to either the **OTAA mode** or **ABP mode** section.



#### OTAA Mode

When setting up a new device in TTN its default is to join in OTAA mode. For configuration, you need the following three parameters: **Device EUI, Application EUI** and **App Key**. You can get them all from the **Overview page**.
