## Overview

### Description

**RAK811 Breakout Board** is an easy to use, compact and low power long range LoRa® technology with wireless transceiver capabilities. A combination of RAK811 chipset and RAK811 Breakout Board with Semtech SX1276 at its core which takes advantage of all LoRa® features.

The RAK811 Breakout Board complies with the latest LoRaWAN® Class A & C protocol specifications with fully supported LoRaWAN® 1.0.2 stack in its firmware. It has a simple and straightforward setup and can quickly access LWPA IOT platforms. Additionally, it supports LoRa® Point to Point (P2P) communications which helps customers in implementing their own private LoRa® network.

The node can work in a number of modes, with different data rates and read data from the attached sensors with the help of its serial AT commands.

This board is a complete solution in developing your LoRaWAN® protocol techniques. A few of its application includes: Automated Meters Reading, Home and Building Automation, Wireless Alarm and Security Systems, Industrial Monitoring and Control and Long Range Irrigation Systems.
