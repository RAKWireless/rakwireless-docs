:::tip 📝 NOTE
Purchasing the [RAK2013 WisLink Cellular Pi Hat](../../RAK2013) separately with the intent of adding a cellular feature in your existing RAK7243 WisGate Developer Gateway is not possible. Hence, purchase the RAK7243C/7244C instead, as it is a specifically modified gateway that is composed of RAK2245 and RAK2013.
