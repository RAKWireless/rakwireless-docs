### Power on the Gateway

1. Attach the LoRa¬Æ Antenna

First and foremost, screw on the antenna to the SMA connector back panel of the RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
 Do not power the device if the LoRa¬Æ Antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage in the RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite.
:::

2. **Power** the Gateway **ON**

It is recommended to use the **12V DC adapter** that comes with the RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite. Optionally, you can use your own **PoE cable** and **injector** since the device supports PoE.

#### Reset Key Functions
The function of the **Reset** key is as follows:

1. **Short press**: Restarts the Gateway
2. **Long press** (**5 seconds and above**): Restore Factory Settings


### Access the Gateway

In this section, several ways in accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
 Do not power the device if the LoRa¬Æ Antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage in the RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite."
:::

#### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the Gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find an SSID named like "**RAK7258_XXXX**" on your PC's Wi-Fi Network List. "**XXXX**" is is the last two bytes of the Gateway MAC address.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 No password is required to connect via Wi-Fi
:::

* Using your preferred Web browser, login the credentials provided below:
    * **Browser Address**: `192.168.230.1`
    * **Username**: root
    * **Password**: root

  caption="Web User Interface Log-in"
/> 

#### WAN Port DHCP IP

When DHCP Server is in the network where the gateway WAN interface is located, the WAN interface can automatically get the IP address. After inquiring the IP address of the gateway through DHCP Server, the WEB management platform of the gateway can be accessed through the DHCP IP address of WAN interface. Same as with the Wi-Fi AP mode, the same IP Address: `192.168.230.1` shall be used to access the **Web Management Platform**.


### Access the Internet

#### Connect through Wi-Fi

Go into the **Network>Wi-Fi Menu** and make sure to enable the **Wireless Client** as it is disabled initially. Enter or click "**Scan**" to choose your **ESSSID**, select the right **Encryption** method and enter the correct **Key**.

  caption="Connect through Wi-Fi Credentials"
/> 

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 Assuming you have entered the correct parameter values you should get an IP address assigned by your Wi-Fi router's (AP) built-in DHCP server. You can use this new IP address to log in via a web browser (same way as in AP mode).
:::

#### Connect through Ethernet/PoE

Connect the **Ethernet Port (ETH)** of the RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite via an Ethernet cable to your **Router**. The router‚Äôs DHCP server should assign an IP Address to the Gateway. You can change the default settings below if you wish (details in the User Manual).

### Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

The Things Network is about enabling low power devices to use long range gateways to connect to an open-source, decentralized network to exchange data with Application. Learn more about The Things Network through their [documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/).

- First, you should have connected your RAK7258 WisGate Edge Lite into the internet through a router according to the method which has been introduced in  the [Access the Internet](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7258/Quickstart/#access-the-internet) section of this document.
- Now go to the TTN Website: [https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and Login. You will then see the following page:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7258/quickstart/2.quickstart/ttn-homepage.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="The Things Network Home Page"
/>


1. In the **Register Gateway** menu, select the ‚Äú**I‚Äôm using the legacy packet forwarder**‚Äù option, and fill-in the Gateway EUI.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7258/quickstart/2.quickstart/register-gateway.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Registering your Gateway"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 The Gateway EUI can be found either on the sticker on the casing or via the LoRa¬Æ Packet Forwarder page in the LoRa¬Æ Gateway menu once you log via the Web UI.
:::

2. Select your [Frequency Plan](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/frequency-plans.html) depending on your location. This should populate the Router field. Optionally you can choose to enter the Gateway coordinates in the map‚Äôs upper right corner and select if the gateway is indoor or outdoor via the Antenna placement field below the map.

3. Upon successful registration you should see the following screen:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7258/quickstart/2.quickstart/ttn-successful.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Gateway successfully connected to The Things Network (TTN)"
/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:
By default, the Gateway is set to connect to TTN. For detailed information about advanced configuration options refer to the [WEB Management Platform - LoRa¬Æ Network](/Knowledge-Hub/Learn/Resources/WEB-Management-Platform/#lora¬Æ-network) section.
