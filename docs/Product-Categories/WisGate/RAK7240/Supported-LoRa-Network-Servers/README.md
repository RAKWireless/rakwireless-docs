# RAK7240 Supported LoRa Network Servers

## AWS IoT Core

Execute the following steps to set up your AWS account and permissions:

<!-- ## Set up Your AWS Account and Permissions --->

### Set up Roles and Policies in IAM

#### Add an IAM Role for CUPS Server

Adding an IAM role will allow the Configuration and Update Server (CUPS) to handle the wireless gateway credentials. 

This procedure needs to be done only once, but must be performed before a LoRaWAN gateway tries to connect with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.

1. Go to the [IAM Roles](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles) page on the IAM console.
2. Choose **Create role**.
3. On the Create Role page, choose **Another AWS account**. 
4. Enter your **Account ID**, then select **Next: Permissions**.
5. In the search box next to the Filter Policies, type **_AWSIoTWirelessGatewayCertManager_**.
   - If the search results show the policy named **_AWSIoTWirelessGatewayCertManager_**, select it by clicking the checkbox.
   - If the policy does not exist, create one.
      - Go to the [IAM console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).
      - Choose **Policies** from the navigation pane.
      - Choose **Create Policy**, then select the **JSON** tab to open the policy editor. 
      - Replace the existing template with trust policy document.
  
      ```json
      {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
      {
      "Sid": "IoTWirelessGatewayCertManager",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
      "iot:CreateKeysAndCertificate",
      "iot:DescribeCertificate",
      "iot:ListCertificates",
      "iot:RegisterCertificate"
               ],
      "Resource": "*"
                }
            ]
      }   
      ```

      - Choose **Review Policy** to open the Review Page.
      - For the Name, type _**AWSIoTWirelessGatewayCertManager**_.

   :::tip üìù NOTE:
   You must enter the name as **_AWSIoTWirelessGatewayCertManager_** and must not use a different name. This is for consistency with future releases.
   :::

     - For the Description, enter a description of your choice. 
     - Then choose **Create policy**. You will see a confirmation message showing the policy has been created.

6. Choose **Next: Tags**, then **Next: Review**.
7. In Role name, enter _**IoTWirelessGatewayCertManagerRole**_, and then choose to **Create role**.
   
:::tip üìù NOTE:
You must not use a different name.  This is for consistency with future releases.
:::

8. In the confirmation message, choose _**IoTWirelessGatewayCertManagerRole**_ to edit the new role.
9. In the **Summary**, choose the **Trust relationships** tab, and then choose **Edit trust relationship**.
10.  In the **Policy Document**, change the **Principal** property to represent the IoT Wireless service:

```json
"Principal": { 
"Service": "iotwireless.amazonaws.com"  
},
```

- After changing the Principal property, the complete policy document should look like the following:

```json
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
    {
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": {
"Service": "iotwireless.amazonaws.com"
        },
"Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
"Condition": {}
    }
    ]
}
```

11.  Choose **Update Trust Policy** to save your changes and exit.
At this point, you have created the _**IoTWirelessGatewayCertManagerRole**_ and you won't need to do this again.

:::tip üìù NOTE:

```
5. Choose **Update Trust Policy.**  Under Trusted entities, you will see: *The identity provider(s) iotwireless.amazonaws.com*.
 
### Add the Gateway to AWS IoT

<b> Requirements </b>

To complete setting up your gateway, you need the following:

- LoRaWAN region. For example, if the gateway is deployed in a US region, the gateway must support LoRaWAN region US915.
- Gateway LNS-protocols. Currently, the LoRa Basics Station protocol is supported.
- Gateway ID (GatewayEUI) or serial number. This is used to establish the connection between the LNS and the gateway. Consult the documentation for your gateway to locate this value.
- Add minimum software versions required, including Basics Station 2.0.5.

#### Add the LoRaWAN Gateway

To register the Gateway with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, execute these steps:

1. Go to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot). 
2. Select **Wireless connectivity** in the navigation panel on the left.
3. Choose **Intro**, and then choose **Get started**. This step is needed to pre-populate the default profiles.
4. Under **Add LoRaWAN gateways and wireless devices**, choose **Add gateway**.
5. In the **Add gateway section**, fill in the **GatewayEUI** and **Frequency band (RF Region)** fields.
6. Enter a descriptive name in the **Name** ‚Äì optional field. It is recommended that you use the GatewayEUI as the name.
7. Choose **Add gateway**.
8. On the **Configure your Gateway** page, find the section titled **Gateway certificate**. 
9. Select **Create certificate**.
10. Once the **Certificate created and associated with your gateway** message is shown, select **Download certificates** to download the certificate (*xxxxx.cert.pem*) and private key (*xxxxxx.private.key*).
11. In the section **Provisioning credentials**, choose **Download server trust certificates** to download the **CUPS (cups.trust)** and **LNS (lns.trust)** server trust certificates.
12. Copy the CUPS and LNS endpoints and save them for use while configuring the gateway.
13. Choose **Submit** to add the gateway.

### Add a LoRaWAN Device to AWS IoT

<b> Requirements: </b>

- Locate and note the following specifications about your endpoint device.
    - **LoRaWAN Region**: This must match the gateway LoRaWAN region. The following Frequency bands (RF regions) are supported:
        o	EU868
        o	US915
        o	EU433
    - **MAC Version**: This must be one of the following:
        o	V1.0.2
        o	v1.0.3 
        o	v1.1
    - OTAA v1.0x and OTAA v1.1 are supported.
    - ABP v1.0x and ABP v1.1 are supported.

- Locate and note the following information from your device manufacturer: 
    - For OTAA v1.0x devices: DevEUI, AppKey, AppEUI
    - For OTAA v1.1 devices: DevEUI, AppKey, NwkKey, JoinEUI
    - For ABP v1.0x devices: DevEUI, DevAddr, NwkSkey, AppSkey
    - For ABP v1.1 devices: DevEUI, DevAddr, NwkSEnckey, FNwkSIntKey, SNwkSIntKey, AppSKey

#### Verify Profiles

AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN supports device profiles and service profiles.  Device profiles contain the communication and protocol parameter values the device needs to communicate with the network server.  Service profiles describe the communication parameters the device needs to communicate with the application server.

Some pre-defined profiles are available for device and service profiles.  Before proceeding, verify that these profile settings match the devices you will be setting up to work with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.

1. Navigate to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot). In the navigation pane, choose **Wireless connectivity**.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Profiles**.
3. In the **Device Profiles** section, there are some pre-defined profiles listed.
4. Check each of the profiles to determine if one of them will work for you.
5. If not, select **Add device profile** and set up the parameters as needed. For US 915 as an example, the values are:
      - MacVersion 1.0.3
      - RegParamsRevision RP002-1.0.1
      - MaxEirp 10
      - MaxDutyCycle 10
      - RfRegion US915
      - SupportsJoin true

6. Continue once you have a device profile that will work for you.
7. In the **Service Profiles** section, there are some pre-defined profiles listed. Check each of the profiles to determine if one of them will work for you.
8. If not, select **Add service profile** and set up the parameters as needed.  As an example, the default service profile parameters are shown below.  However, only the _**AddGwMetadata**_ setting can be changed at this time.
      - UlRate 60
      - UlBucketSize 4096
      - DlRate 60
      - DlBucketSize 4096
      - AddGwMetadata true
      - DevStatusReqFreq 24
      - DrMax 15
      - TargetPer 5
      - MinGwDiversity 1

9. Proceed only if you have a device and service profile that will work for you.

#### Set up a Destination for Device Traffic

Because most LoRaWAN devices don't send data to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN in a format that can be consumed by AWS services, traffic must first be sent to a Destination.  A Destination represents the AWS IoT rule that processes a device's data for use by AWS services. This AWS IoT rule contains the SQL statement that selects the device's data and the topic rule actions that send the result of the SQL statement to the services that will use it.

For more information on Destinations, refer to the AWS [LoRaWAN Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan.html).

A destination consists of a Rule and a Role. To set up the destination, execute the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot). In the navigation pane, choose **Wireless connectivity**, and then **Destinations**.
2. Choose **Add Destination**.
3. On the Add destination page, in the **Permissions** section, select the IAM role you had created earlier, from the drop-down.
4. Under **Destination details**, enter _**ProcessLoRa**_ as the Destination name, and an appropriate description under **Destination description ‚Äì optional**.


:::tip üìù NOTE:
The Destination name can be anything. For getting started and consistency, choose ProcessLoRa for the first integration with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.
:::

5. For **Rule name**, enter _**LoRaWANRouting**_. Ignore the section **Rules configuration ‚Äì Optional** for now.  The Rule will be set up later in the "Hello World" sample application. See Create the IoT Rule for the destination.
6. Choose **Add Destination**.  You will see a message "_Destination added_", indicating the destination has been successfully added.

#### Register the Device

Now, register an endpoint device with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN as follows:

1. Go to the [AWS IoT console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/iot).
2. Select **Wireless connectivity** in the navigation panel on the left.
3. Select **Devices**, then choose **Add wireless device**.
4. On the **Add device** page, select the LoRaWAN specification version in the drop-down under **Wireless device specification**.
5. Under **LoRaWAN specification and wireless device configuration**, enter the **DevEUI** and confirm it in the **Confirm DevEUI** field.
6. Enter the remaining fields as per the OTAA/ABP choice you made above.
7. Enter a name for your device in the **Wireless device name ‚Äì optional field**.
8. In the **Profiles** section, under **Wireless device profile**, find a drop-down option that corresponds to your device and region. 

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Compare your device details to ensure the device profile is correct.  If there are no valid default options, you will have to create a new profile. See the Verify Profiles section.
:::

9. Choose **Next**.
10. Choose the destination you created earlier (_ProcessLoRa_) from the drop-down under **Choose destination**.
11. Choose **Add device**.
12. You will see a message saying "_Wireless device added_", indicating that your device has been set up successfully.
