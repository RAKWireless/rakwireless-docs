## Product Configuration

### Accessing Your Gateway

After burning the image into the SD Card, make sure you have inserted the SD Card with the Latest Firmware installed to the **RAK7244C WisGate Developer D4+ Gateway** and the LoRa¬Æ and GPS Antenna attached to it. After which, you can now safely power on the gateway. In this document, several ways in accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

::: warning
Before powering the Raspberry Pi 4 you should install the LoRa¬Æ and GPS antennas. Not doing so might damage the boards.
:::

#### 1. Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the Gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find an SSID named like "**Rakwireless_XXXX**" on your PC Wi-Fi Network List.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7244c/quickstart/2.accessing-gateway/1.lz4jkwc4hc5bulz0tial.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="RAKWireless Access Point"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE:
‚ÄúXXXX‚Äù is the last 2 bytes of your RAK7244C WiFi MAC address. Connect to this Wi-Fi SSID using the password provided below. Take note also of the default IP address of the Gateway provided below as this will be needed in connecting via SSH.

- **Wi-Fi Password:** rakwireless
- **Default IP Address:** `192.168.230.1`
  :::

#### 2. Via the Ethernet Port on the Raspberry Pi 4

You can also connect your PC with the Gateway through an Ethernet cable. By default, the IP address of the Gateway‚Äôs Ethernet interface is `192.168.10.10`, so you need to set the IP address of your PC‚Äôs Ethernet to the same network segment, for example, `192.168.10.20`_._

- To do this in Windows, go to Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center and Click **Ethernet**

<rk-img

::: tip üìù NOTE:
Make sure to select the \"**I'm using the legacy packet forwarder**\" check box.
:::

- **Gateway EUI** - refers to the Gatway ID you obtained from the previous step. In case you forgot, just type `gateway-version` in the command line. This must be the same with the Gateway's True Gateway ID otherwise you will fail to register your Gateway on TTN.
- **Description** - A human readable description of your Gateway.
- **Frequency Plan** - This is the frequency you want to use and it must be the same with Gateway and the Node.
- **Router** - The router this gateway will connect to. To reduce latency, pick a router that is in a region which is close to the location of the gateway.
- **Location** - Choose the location of the Gateway by entering its coordinates. This is reflected on the Gateway World Map!
- **Antenna Placement** - refers to the location of your antenna whether indoor or outdoor.

Click Register Gateway and wait for a couple of minutes . If the status of your gateway is **Connected**, Congratulations! :tada: Your Gateway is now connected to the The Things Network (TTN).



### Connect the Gateway with ChirpStack

The ChirpStack or previously known as LoRaServer project provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN¬Æ networks. You can learn more about ChirpStack [**here**](https://www.chirpstack.io/)

For the RAK7244C WisGate Developer D4+ Gateway, there are 2 ways to use the ChirpStack:


##### 1. Using the built-in ChirpStack

There is a built-in ChirpStack in every RAK Developer gateway if you use the latest firmware.

- When you use it for the first time after burning the latest firmware, the Gateway will work in the EU868 Band and use the built-in ChirpStack as its default LoRa¬Æ Server. If you don't want to change the frequency or LoRa¬Æ Server, you don't have to do anything as this will be configured automatically when the Gateway boots.
- However if it is not the first time and you want to use the built-in ChirpStack as the LoRa¬Æ Server, follow the steps discussed in [Configuring the Gateway](#configuring-the-gateway) section.
- **Optional:** If ever you disabled the AP Mode and you have connected it to your own Wifi network (Client Mode). You can search for your gateway‚Äôs IP Address via [**Advanced IP Scanner**](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/). Copy the IP Address of your Gateway, it should have a Manufacturer name of **Raspberry Pi Foundation**:

/>

There is a Web-based UI that comes with the ChirpStack instance. Simply open a browser and enter the following credentials:

- **Browser Address**: "Gateway IP Address:8080" (**Example**: http://192.168.254.176:8080)
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin

::: warning
It is advisable to change your password to tighten the security of your account. You can change this by clicking the \"change password\" button at the user icon.

- Everything should be pre-configured: Device profiles have been created, the Gateway has been registered with the server, etc. If you go to the Gateways tab and click on rak_gateway, you should see the Gateway details page.

/>

- Go to the rak_gateway and see the "Last seen" status. It must be a few seconds ago which signifies that the Gateway is visible in the ChirpStack server.

##### 2. Using an Independent ChirpStack

You can setup an Independent ChirpStack by yourself. This is a lot more complicated having to deploy a remote ChirpStack by yourself but Chirpstack provided a detailed guide on how to do it [here](https://www.chirpstack.io/guides/debian-ubuntu/).

  caption="Chirpstack Getting Started Guide on Ubuntu"
/>

::: warning
Remember to run the \"`sudo gateway-config`\" command in the CLI and point the Gateway to the IP address of the machine you just installed Chirpstack on. This can be done in item 2 in the menu \"**Setup RAK Gateway LoRa¬Æ concentrator**\"!
:::

- Assuming you have set it up correctly, Login to your ChirpStack to register your Gateway by opening the ChirpStack's web page in a browser by entering "IP Address of ChirpStack:8080".
