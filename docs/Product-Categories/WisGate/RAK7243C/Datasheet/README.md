## Overview

### Description

The **RAK7243C WisGate Developer D3+ Gateway** is a device that consists of Raspberry Pi 3B+, RAK2245 Pi HAT which includes a GPS module and a Heat Sink for better performance and thermal heat dissipation management, and a RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT and it‚Äôs housing is built with an aluminum casing.

For the build-in RAK2245 Pi HAT, it uses the SX1301 chip from Semtech which built-in LPWAN concentrator IP core is a powerful digital signal processing engine. It is able to receive up to 8 LoRa¬Æ packets simultaneously sent with different spreading factors on different channels and available in multiple variants so it can be used for internartinal standard bands. This unique capability allows to implement innovative network architectures advantageous over other short range systems. For the build-in RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT, it supports optional QUECTEL BG96 / EG91 / EG95 which can supports NB-IOT / CAT-M / CAT1 LTE / CAT4 LTE. It follows Raspberry Pi specifications and is easy to mount with Raspberry Pi and RAK2245 Pi HAT module.
