## Product Configuration

### Accessing your Gateway

After burning the image into the SD Card, make sure you have inserted the SD Card with the Latest Firmware installed to the **RAK7244 WisGate Developer D4 Gateway** and the LoRa¬Æ and GPS Antenna attached to it. After which, you can now safely power on the gateway. In this section, several ways in accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
Before powering the Raspberry Pi 4 you should install the LoRa¬Æ and GPS antennas. Not doing so might damage the boards.
:::

#### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find an SSID named like "**Rakwireless_XXXX**" on your PC Wi-Fi Network List.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7244/quickstart/4.accessing your gateway/wifi.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="RAKwireless Access Point"
/>

::: tip üìù NOTE:
‚ÄúXXXX‚Äù is the last 2 bytes of your RAK7244‚Äôs WiFi MAC address. Connect to this Wi-Fi SSID using the password provided below. Take note also of the default IP address of the gateway provided below as this will be needed in connecting via SSH.

- **Wi-Fi Password:** rakwireless
- **Default IP Address:** `192.168.230.1`
  :::

#### Raspberry Pi 4 Ethernet Port

You can also connect your PC with the gateway through an Ethernet cable. By default, the IP address of the gGateway‚Äôs Ethernet interface is `192.168.10.10`, so you need to set the IP address of your PC‚Äôs Ethernet to the same network segment, for example, `192.168.10.20`.

- To do this in Windows, go to Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center and Click **Ethernet**.

<rk-img

### Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack

The ChirpStack or previously known as LoRaServer project provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN¬Æ networks. You can learn more about ChirpStack [here](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

For the RAK7244 WisGate Developer D4 Gateway there are 2 ways to use the ChirpStack:

#### 1. Using the built-in ChirpStack
There is a built-in ChirpStack in every RAK Developer gateway if you use the latest firmware.

* When you use it for the first time after burning the latest firmware, the Gateway will work in the EU868 Band and use the built-in ChirpStack as its default LoRa¬Æ Server. If you don't want to change the frequency or LoRa¬Æ Server, you don't have to do anything as this will be configured automatically when the Gateway boots.
* However if it is not the first time and you want to use the built-in ChirpStack as the LoRa¬Æ Server, follow the steps discussed in [Configuring the Gateway](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7244/Quickstart/#configuring-the-gateway) the Gateway section.
* **Optional**: If ever you disabled the AP Mode and you have connected it to your own Wifi network (Client Mode). You can search for your gateway‚Äôs IP Address via [**Advanced IP Scanner**](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/). Copy the IP Address of your Gateway, it should have a Manufacturer name of **Raspberry Pi Foundation**:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7244/quickstart/8.connecting to chirpstack/advanced-ip-scanner.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="IP address of your RAK7244 using IP Scanner"
/>

* There is a Web-based UI that comes with the ChirpStack instance. Simply open a browser and enter the following credentials:
    * **Browser Address**: `<Gateway IP address>:8080` (**Example**: http://192.168.254.176:8080)
    * **Username**: admin
    * **Password**: admin

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
 It is advisable to change your password to tighten the security of your account. You can change this by clicking the "**change password**" button at the user icon.
:::

  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7244/quickstart/8.connecting to chirpstack/chirpstack-ui.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="ChirpStack Web-based UI"
/>

* Everything should be pre-configured: Device profiles have been created, the Gateway has been registered with the server, etc. If you go to the Gateways tab and click on rak_gateway, you should see the Gateway details page.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7244/quickstart/8.connecting to chirpstack/gateways-in-chirpstack.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="Available Gateways in Chirpstack"
/>

* Go to the rak_gateway and see the "**Last seen**" status. It must be a few seconds ago which signifies that the Gateway is visible in the ChirpStack server.

  caption="Chirpstack Getting Started Guide on Ubuntu"
/>

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
 Remember to run the "`sudo gateway-config`" command in the CLI and point the Gateway to the IP address of the machine you just installed Chirpstack on. This can be done in item 2 in the menu [Setup RAK Gateway LoRa¬Æ concentrator](/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7244/Quickstart/#setup-rak-gateway-lora¬Æ-concentrator).
:::

* Assuming you have set it up correctly, Login to your ChirpStack to register your Gateway by opening the ChirpStack's web page in a browser by entering:
    * **Browser Address**: `<IP Address of ChirpStack>:8080`
    * **Username**: admin
