rak_desc: RAK7244 is a base model built with the RAK2245 Pi HAT stacked with the newest Raspberry Pi 4, along with the GPS module and heat sink, which increase the performance and thermal dissipation. With its ready to use Raspbian based firmware, it is easy to connect the gateway to any standard LoRaWAN Server. Thus, the device is capable of tackling applications related to Smart Grids, Intelligent Farms, and other IoT Enterprise applications.

:::tip 📝 NOTE
Purchasing the [RAK2013 WisLink Cellular Pi Hat](../../RAK2013) separately with the intent of adding a cellular feature in your existing RAK7244 WisGate Developer Gateway is not possible. Hence, purchase the RAK7243C/7244C instead, as it is a specifically modified gateway that is composed of RAK2245 and RAK2013.

## Product Background

The **RAK7244 WisGate Developer D4 Gateway** is a complete and cost efficient Gateway Solution that will help you get started in developing a full LoRa System. It is built with the **RAK2245 Pi HAT** stacked with the newest **Raspberry Pi 4**, along with the GPS module and Heat Sink, increasing its performance and thermal dissipation. The housing for the device is durable and entirely built from aluminum.

The gateway has a powerful LoRa digital signal processing engine from Semtech SX1301 RF front end chip. It is capable of receiving up to 8 LoRa packets simultaneously sent with different spreading factors on different channels. It is available in multiple variants to be accessible in all LoRa Alliance® frequency bands. This breakthrough allows innovative network architectures to be implemented that has a huge impact over other short range systems.

Overall, this gateway has various functionalities that are ideal for prototyping, proof-of-concept demonstrations and evaluation on future deployment scenarios. With its ready to use Raspbian based firmware, it is now possible to connect the Gateway to any standard LoRaWAN Server. The device is capable of tackling applications related to Smart Grids, Intelligent Farms and other IoT Enterprise applications.
