## Overview

### Description

The RAK7244 WisGate Developer D4 Gateway is a device that consists of a Raspberry Pi 4, a RAK2245 Pi HAT, which includes a GPS module and a Heat Sink for better performance and thermal heat dissipation management.

There is a total of 3 configuration options:

1. **RAK7244** - this is the base model with the Raspberry Pi 4 and RAK2245.
2. **RAK7244C** - this is the Cellular Version that includes the Raspberry Pi 4, RAK2245, and the RAK2013 Cellular Pi Hat
3. **RAK7244P** - · this version allows for powering the gateway via PoE by adding the RAK9003 Pi HAT to the base configuration (RPi 4 + RAK2245 + RAK9003)

The built-in RAK2245 Pi HAT uses the SX1301 RF front-end chip from Semtech®, which is a powerful LoRa® digital processing engine. It is able to receive up to 8 LoRa® packets simultaneously sent with different spreading factors on different channels and available in multiple variants so it can be used for all LoRa Allience® frequency bands. This unique capability allows for innovative network architectures to be implemented, that are advantageous over other short-range systems. The built-in RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT in the RAK7244C, is based on the EG95 from Quectel, which is an LTE CAT4 module optimized specifically for M2M and IoT Applications. The RAK7244P is particularly suitable for deployment in cases where there is existing networking infrastructure and PoE is provisioned.

The RAK7244 WisGate Developer D4 Gateway is ideal for prototyping, proof-of-concept demonstrations or for the evaluation on future deployment scenarios. It includes a ready to use Firmware based on Raspbian OS, that makes it possible to connect the Gateway to any standard LoRaWAN® Server. It is developer friendly as the large Raspbian OS community is a well-established one. It is especially suited to addressing a variety of applications like Smart Grids, Intelligent Farms and other IoT Enterprise applications.

## Specifications

### Overview

The overview covers the RAK7244 board overview and block diagram of the three configuration options:RAK7244, RAK7244C and RAK7244P.

#### Board Overview

The outer dimensions of Casing are 92 x 68.3 x 53.5 mm as shown below. They are the same for all 3 models: RAK7244/7244C/7244P. The example in Figure 3 is RAK7244C

#### Block Diagram

##### RAK7244

The figure below summarizes the basic building blocks of RAK7244. The RAK2245 is an essential part of any of the RAK7244 models as it provides all LoRaWAN® connectivity. It receives and transmits LoRa® Frames and takes care of modulating/demodulating the signals among others. The processing of the LoRa® Frames as well as higher level protocol related tasks is done by the embedded host system (Raspberry Pi). Received and processed LoRa® Frames are being sent to a LoRaWAN® Server. The segmentation of protocol related tasks is outside the scope of this document.
