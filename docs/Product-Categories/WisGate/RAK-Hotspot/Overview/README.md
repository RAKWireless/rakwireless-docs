rak_desc: RAK Hotspot is an efficient miner for a new cryptocurrency, Helium (HNT). It can be set-up completely in minutes using a smartphone and can easily manages Hotspots and tokens from the mobile app. It offers Low Power that uses about the same amount as a 5W LED bulb, and it has LongFi™ technology that maximizes range and battery life.

## Product Background

**Hotspot Details**

- Efficient miner for a new cryptocurrency, **Helium (HNT)**
- Complete set-up in minutes using a smartphone
- **LongFi technology** maximizes range and battery life without Wi-Fi, cellular or Bluetooth
- Low Power – only uses about the same amount as an LED light bulb (5W)
- Easily manage Hotspots and tokens from the mobile app
- LongFi™ Technology

**Helium LongFi** is a technology architecture that combines a leading wireless technology, LoRaWAN, and the Helium Blockchain. LongFi is optimized for miles of range, and long battery life for IoT devices.

![proof-of-coverage](/assets/images/wisgate/rak-hotspot-miner/icons/proof-of-coverage.png)

RAK Hotspot Miners earn Helium when devices connect, and for validating wireless coverage delivered by peers. Using a system called Proof-of-Coverage, RAK Hotspot Miners earn more Helium when they are in range of other RAK Hotspot Miners, but need to be at least 300 meters apart.

Range depends on the environment: for rural areas, **up to 10 miles or more**, but for more dense areas, **up to a mile**. Single RAK Hotspot Miners earn less as they can only issue Challenges over the internet and cannot participate in Proof-of-Coverage.

- Deliver may square miles of coverage from a single RAK Hotspot
- Based on initial testing, only about 50 to 100 RAK Hotspot are needed to provide complete
coverage for an entire city.

- Create a new global network for billions of devices
- Any IoT device can become Helium-enabled using readily available off-the-shelf hardware components, software, and a reference design that is open source for anyone to improve upon.
