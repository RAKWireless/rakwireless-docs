::: tip üìù NOTE:
‚ÄúXXXX‚Äù is the last 2 bytes of your RAK7246‚Äôs WiFi MAC address. Connect to this Wi-Fi SSID using the password provided below. Take note also of the default IP address of the Gateway provided below as this will be needed in connecting via SSH.

- **Wi-Fi Password:** rakwireless
- **Default IP Address:** `192.168.230.1`
  :::

#### Log into the Gateway

##### 1. Windows OS

SSH (Secure Shell) is typically used to log in to a remote machine and execute commands. There are a lot of free and good SSH Clients out there namely [**Putty**](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), [**BitVise SSH Client**](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download), [**MobaXterm**](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and many more. Feel free to choose one that fits your needs, you will be using Putty for this guide.

3. **Restart packet -forwarder** - used to restart the LoRa¬Æ packet forwarded process.
4. **Edit packet-forwarder config**- used to open the global_conf.json file, in order to edit LoRaWAN¬Æ parameters manually.
5. **Configure Wifi** - used to configure the Wi-Fi settings in order to connect to a network.

#### Connect through Wi-Fi

If you want to connect through Wi-Fi, it can easily be done with the Wireless capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Zero W by choosing "**5 Configure WIFI**". By default, the RAK7246G WisGate Developer D0 Gateway works in Wi-Fi AP Mode. In order for the Gateway to connect to the router, it must work in Wi-Fi Client Mode.

<rk-img 
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/config-wifi.png" 
  width="100%"
  caption="Configuration options for WIFI"
/>

There are 5 options to choose from in the Wi-Fi configuration menu:

1. **Enable AP Mode/Disable Client Mode** - the Gateway will work in Wi-Fi Access Point Mode after rebooting while the Wi-Fi Client Mode will be disabled (this is the default mode).
2. **Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode** - the Gateway will work in Wi-Fi Client mode after rebooting, while Wi-FI AP Mode will be disabled.
3. **Modify SSID and pwd for AP Mode** - used to modify the SSID and password of the Wi-Fi AP. Only works if the Wi-Fi AP Mode is enabled.
4. **Add New SSID for Client** - this is used if you want to connect to a new Wi-Fi Network. Only works in Wi-Fi Client mode.
5. **Change Wi-Fi Country** - this is used to modify the Resident Country to match with Wi-Fi standards.

::: tip üìù NOTE:
In order to enable Wi-Fi Client Mode, you have to disable first the Wi-Fi AP Mode
:::

Once Wi-Fi AP Mode has been disabled by choosing "**2 Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode**", you can now then connect to a new Wi-Fi Network by choosing "**4 Add New SSID for Client**":

<rk-img 
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/add_ssid.png" 
  width="100%"

  width="100%"
  caption="Password of the Wi-Fi"
/>

- Lastly, reboot the gateway using the command `sudo reboot` in the command line and it will connect to the router successfully.

```sh
sudo reboot
```

#### Optional Configurations

These configurations under this section are only optional and situational.

##### Reverting Back to Wi-Fi AP Mode

In the event that you have entered either or both incorrect Wi-Fi SSID and Password in the Wi-Fi Client Mode setup for the RAK7246G WisGate Developer D0 Gateway to connect to the router, follow these set of steps for you to work again in Wi-Fi AP Mode and redo the setup.

- Remove the SD Card from your RAK7246G WisGate Developer D0 Gateway and insert it into your PC. Your PC should be able to detect it same with the image below:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/rak_ap.png"
