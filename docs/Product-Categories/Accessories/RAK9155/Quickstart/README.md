### Safety Precautions

RAK9155 is designed with full consideration for safety. However, all electrical appliances can be dangerous if used inappropriately; **it can cause a fire or electric shock that leads to severe injury. For your protection, please read these safety precautions thoroughly**. 

- **Instructions**

Use designated cable. A non-designated cable use can cause an electric shock. Be sure to use the cable designated in this manual.  

- **Prohibitions**

Do not damage cables. If you damage a cable, it can cause a fire or electric shock.  

1. Do not work over or damage a cable.  
2. Do not place heavy objects on a cable or pull the cable.  
3. Do not place a heater near the cable, which may result in the cable overheating. 
4. Do not tuck down a cable when installing in a rack. 
- **Instructions**

Connect the power cable and the communication cable properly. 

If you connect a power cable improperly, contact resistance will increase and it may damage the parts or cause a fire.  

Insert the connector of the communication cable all the way in. If it is connected improperly, the system may be deactivated. 

- **Prohibitions**
1. Do not install in a closed area. If the module/controller is installed in a closed area with no air-conditioning, heat may build up inside the set and cause a fire.  

2. Do not place the set in direct sunlight or near a heater. Doing so can cause deformation, a breakdown, or a fire. Pay extra attention when you place the set near windows.  

3. Do not install the set where excessive oil smoke, steam, moisture, or dust is contained in the air. If the set is installed in such a place, it may cause a fire or electric shock.  
- **Instructions**
1. Wear insulating gloves and protection glasses during installation and connection  
2. Wear insulating gloves and protection glasses during the installation and connection of the set to prevent electric shock or other injuries.  
- **Keep Dry**
1. Do not allow water and/or foreign objects inside the battery.  
2. Water or foreign objects inside the battery can cause a fire or electric shock.  
3. If any water or foreign objects inside the battery, in case any malfunction happens, please turn off the POWER ON/OFF switch in order to shut down, and remove the power connector from **RAK9155**. 
- **Do not disassemble**

Do not open the set unnecessarily. Opening and modifying the unit can cause a fire or electric shock. 

:::danger <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:red;"></i> CAUTION

## Installation

### Pre-Installation Preparation

The equipment is heavy, please ensure personal safety when carrying it.
During installation, please ensure the installer complies with all the necessary safety regulations to ensure personal safety.
Do not place equipment and mounting kit on pedestrian walkways to avoid accidental damage to equipment.

### Carry the Equipment

You can carry the equipment with both hands. If the equipment is lifted with one hand, a handle needs to be installed. The handle is fixed to the equipment with two M6 screws. Before lifting the equipment, please confirm that the screws are fixed securely. You can remove the handle before installing the device.

### Installation

:::tip 📝 NOTE
The diameter of the pole that is supported by the brackets is 50-75mm. If the pole diameter is more than this value, larger hose clamps can be used. The standard mounting kit does not include larger hose clamps. If needed, they should be purchased separately.
:::

1. Fix the mounting bracket on the pole with three hose clamps.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/accessories/rak9155/quickstart/07.png"
  width="15%"
  caption="Fix mounting bracket"
/>

2. Install two M6 screws on the back of the equipment, leave a gap of about 3 mm.
3. Connect the Cables to the circular connectors. The other terminal of 2pin cables (PV INPUT1 and PV INPUT2) are connected to the PV panel outputs.

  caption="Install screws and connect cables"
/>

:::tip 📝 NOTE
The cables should be connected before installing equipment on the pole, otherwise it is difficult to do it. Before cable connection, make sure the pin definition of the cables connected to PV panels is correct.
:::

4. First, hang the equipment on the mounting bracket, then tighten the two screws that were left loose and screw the other two screws to secure the mount.

<rk-img

:::tip 📝 NOTE
The ground wire is not provided with the kit. Determine the actual distance needed before purchasing/procuring the ground cable.
:::

## Power ON and OFF

:::tip 📝 NOTE
Double-check the precautions for use in section **Precautions for Use**.
:::

### System Power ON

1. Press the Power Switch button, green LED should be blinking.

:::tip 📝 NOTE
When RAK9155 is connected to the solar panel during the day, it’s normal to see a green LED blinking without turning on the Power Switch button. Turn on the Power Switch even though the green LED is blinking. If RAK9155 does not connect to either the load or the solar panel, the green LED would be off in 2 minutes.
:::

### System Power OFF

:::warning ⚠️ WARNING
Confirmed that the system is off before taking off the DC cables.
:::

1. Press the Power Switch button, the green LED should turn off.
2. Remove the PV INPUT cables first, and then the OUTPUT cable.

## Transportation and Storage

### Transportation
