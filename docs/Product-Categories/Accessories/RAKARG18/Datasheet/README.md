# 863-870 MHz 5 dBi Fiberglass Antenna Datasheet

## Overview

### Product Description

RAK’s 5 dBi fiberglass antenna is an outdoor, high-performance antenna, designed to withstand harsh outdoor conditions. It is specially designed for LoRa® in the 863-870MHz band – EU868, IN865, and RU864.

The antenna connector is one with the antenna body - this design further increases the resistance of the antenna to external conditions.

With a length of only 480 mm, this antenna will be the best fit for your LPWAN gateway or outdoor deployed RAK Hotspot.

:::tip 📝 NOTE:
This antenna is designed to be directly mounted on the enclosure of the Gateway. It is suitable for the following RAK products:
- [RAK7240](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak7240-outdoor-lpwan-gateway?utm_source=RAK7240WisGateEdgePrime&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
- [RAK7249](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak7249-diy-outdoor-gateway?utm_source=RAK7249Max&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
