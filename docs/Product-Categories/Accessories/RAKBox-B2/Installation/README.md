**Step 4:** If an external connection is required, for example an external sensor, remove the plug on the longer side of the enclosure and replace it with the gland. Pull the cable to the external device through the gland and make sure the lid of the gland is closed properly. If the gland is not closed properly, there is a chance for water and humidity to enter into the enclosure and damage the WisBlock.
